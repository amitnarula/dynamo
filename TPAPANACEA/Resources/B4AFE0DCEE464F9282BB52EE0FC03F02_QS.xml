    <transcript>What exactly does Global Witness do? We investigate, we report, to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict -- for stealing millions from citizens around the world, also known as state looting, and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to change the system itself. And we're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations, like in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health and education budget combined. Or in Liberia, where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia, which has led to the destruction of much of its forests. Well, that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is, there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life.
	Sample Answer : Global Witness investigates people really responsible for funding conflict and for destroying the environment; they do this because many of the countries rich in natural resources are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. Global Witness is against anonymous companies because after investigations they exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies are affecting the people of the country. Political corruption in Malaysia has led to the destruction of much of its forests because of such companies.</transcript>

    <transcript>All spiders make silk at some point in their life. Most spiders use copious amounts of silk, and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk, as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years. It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. There are many kinds of spider silk. For example, this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. When you look at this orb web, you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk, while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks: the filament and the sticky droplet. How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk? To answer that, you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for those of us spider silk biologists, this is what we call the "business end" of the spider.
	Sample Answer : All spiders make silk as it is essential to their survival and reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk. Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. There are many kinds of spider silk.  The question arises how does spider make so many kinds of silk? Silk comes out of the spinnerets of the spider.</transcript>

    <transcript>About ten hundred, Europe was beginning a period of great change. One reason was the religious wars known as the crusades. These wars were efforts by Europeans who were mainly Roman Catholic Christians. They wanted to force Muslims out of what is now the Middle East. The crusades began at the end of the eleventh century. They continued for about two hundred years.
The presence of European armies in the Middle East increased trade, which was controlled by businessmen in Venice and other Italian city-states. The businessmen were earning large profits by transporting and supplying the warring armies.
When the European crusaders returned home, they brought with them some new and useful products. The products included spices, perfumes, silk cloth, steel products and drugs. Such products became highly valued all over Europe. Increased trade resulted which led to the growth of towns. It also created a large number of rich European businessmen.
The European nations were growing. They developed armies and governments. These had to be paid for by taxes from the people. By the 15th century, European countries were ready to explore new parts of the world.

    <transcript>The process of packaging and labeling involves various steps. The first step is putting dry and wet ingredients through grinder into mixer then it goes through preconditioned which gives heat and steam followed by the third step extruder in which there is heat and pressure and through pressure it goes into oven for drying. After drying, the product cools down in cooler and after coating it goes for packaging and labeling.</transcript>

    <transcript>More than one and a half billion people around the world live without electricity. Finding better ways to bring light to the poor is the goal of researchers like David Irvine-Halliday. In the late nineteen nineties, the Canadian professor was working in Nepal when his return flight was canceled. A delay gave him time to take a fourteen-day hiking trip in the Himalayas. As he tells it, one day he looked in the window of a school and noticed how dark it was. This is a common problem for millions of children around the world -- and not just at school, but also at home. Many families use kerosene oil lamps. There are many problems with these lamps. They produce only a small amount of light. They are dangerous to breathe. And they are a big fire danger, causing many injuries and deaths each year. Kerosene costs less than other forms of lighting, but it is still costly in poor countries. Professor Irvine-Halliday says many people spend well over one hundred dollars a year on the fuel. When he returned to Canada, he began researching ways to provide safe, clean and affordable lighting. He began experimenting with light-emitting diodes, LEDs, at his laboratory at the University of Calgary in Alberta. As a professor of renewable energy, he already knew about the technology. Light-emitting diodes are small glass lamps that use much less electricity than traditional bulbs and last much longer. Professor Irvine-Halliday used a one-watt bright white L.E.D. made in Japan. He found it on the Internet and connected it to a bicycle-powered generator. He remembers thinking it was so bright, a child could read by the light of a single diode. In two thousand, after much research and many experiments, he returned to Nepal to put the systems into homes. His Light Up the World Foundation has now equipped the homes of twenty-five thousand people in fifty-one countries.
	Sample Answer : The major goal of Professor David Irvine- Halliday was to equip poor with bright light. In his 14 day hiking trip in the Himalayas, he noticed the problem faced by students in dark schools and even in homes where families used kerosene oil lamps which are associated with many problems. After returning Canada, he started experimenting LED’s and used one- watt L.E.D. and connected to bicycle- powered generator which proved to be successful. His LUTW now equip many homes in 51 countries.</transcript>

    <transcript>Earth is the only place we know of that has life -- 8.7 million species. We've looked other places, maybe not as hard as we should or we could, but we've looked and haven't found any; Earth is the only place we know of with life. Is Earth special? This is a question I've wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child, and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer. To understand whether there are any planets --out there in our solar system or beyond -- that can support life, the first step is to understand what life here requires. It turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species, life only needs three things. On one side, all life on Earth needs energy. Complex life like us derives our energy from the sun, but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions. There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets. On the other side, all life needs food or nourishment. 
	Sample Answer : Earth is the only place that has life. Other planets in solar system cannot support life. There are three things that life on Earth requires. On one side, all life needs energy and complex life derives their energy from the sun whereas deep underground get energy from chemical reactions. Different energy sources are available on all planets. On the other side, all life needs food or nourishment.</transcript>

    <transcript>We're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us. So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color. And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors.
	Sample Answer : We, terrestrial mammals with trichomatic vision are color addicts who try to bring color underwater. Bill Longley and Charles Martin tried to take the first underwater color photograph with  a pontoon of high- explosive magnesium powder. But it’s not the real image and just an artificial environment. The animals living there have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors.</transcript>

    <transcript>What can you do with earthworms? Some people use the creepy crawlers to catch fish. But others put worms to work making compost. Compost looks and feels like good soil. Gardeners and farmers add it to soil to make plants grow better. You can make compost from food waste at home with or without the help of worms. How the worms help is by first eating and processing the food. It comes out the other end of the worm as rich compost.Kim Gabel from the University of Florida Extension service in Key West suggests using red worms known as red wigglers.KIM GABEL: The red wigglers are the best varieties for doing it because they are more of a surface feeder. Because different worms live in different strata, or portions of the earth.You need a container to hold the waste and the worms. The size of the composting bin depends on how much compost you want to make. You need about a kilogram of worms for each half a kilogram of daily food waste that you add. Kim Gabel says the bin needs holes so the worms can get air. KIM GABEL:  	The worms do breathe. So that is a very important factor, along with they also like to be in the dark.So cover the bin to keep out the light.One thing worms do not like is very high temperatures. 
	Sample Answer : Compost can be made from food waste with the help of worms. Red wigglers can be used in this process. Container is needed to hold the waste and worms whose size depends upon the amount of compost. There should be holes in the bin so that worm can breathe. Then keep the bin out in the light but there should not be high temperatures.</transcript>

    <transcript>Most Africans today, by far, are farmers. And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very   	small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world. Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia. African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to 144 in Asia. Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa. There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa. The small
	farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom. His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty. He comes to
	the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice. She comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
	Sample Answer : Most Africans are small farmers in terms of land in capital they have at their disposal. African agriculture is the most under-capitalized in the world as they have very less arable land. They live a life without much choice as their livelihood is determined by conditions of poverty. They come to market when prices are low and when food is scarce because they has to feed their family.</transcript>

    <transcript> Experts from the United States are working to return the final resting place of King Tutankhamen to its full beauty. The Getty Conservation Institute is cooperating with Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities on the project. Tutankhamen is often called Tut. His tomb is in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile River at Luxor. King Tut ruled Egypt more than three thousand years ago. He became Pharaoh when he was about nine years old. He was probably the son or grandson of Amenhotep the Third, a major ruler. Tut's mother or stepmother may have been Queen Nefertiti. Thousands of people visit King Tutankhamen's tomb every day. The rich beauty of the tomb is
	well known. But experts say his burial place needs scientific attention. Tim Whalen directs the Getty Conservation Institute, which is based in Los Angeles, California. His team will study problems with paintings on walls of the burial room and other areas. Mr. Whalen says the tomb is currently in what he called pretty good condition. He says the final goal of the work is to develop a long-term plan to operate and protect the tomb for years to come. Jeanne Marie Teutonico is the associate director of the Getty Conservation Institute. She will direct other experts in scientific restoration during the five-year project. The study and repair work is expected to cost the G.C.I. about one million, five hundred thousand dollars. Egypt has not yet said how much financial responsibility it will take for the project.
	Sample Answer : The tomb of King Tutankhamen or King Tut is in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile River at Luxor. He ruled Egypt for more than 3000 years ago and became Pharaoh at the age of 9. People visit his tomb but his burial needs scientific attention. Different experts have their views with the goal of developing and protecting tomb for years to come.</transcript>

    <transcript>Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital. The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away. On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
	Sample Answer : The speaker talks about raging debate to lift the people out of poverty but some say that aid system need to be broken. On the other hand, people say we need more aid. And as per the speaker patient capital compliments both the systems. He talks about 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970. The policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, whereas the other’s say that there is need to eradicate diseases such as smallpox and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right but not listening to each other.</transcript>

    <transcript>Business ethics relate to how a company conducts its business in order to make a profit. Although the primary goal of the company may be to make money, it also recognises that it has a responsibility towards the society in which it operates. The term ‘corporate social responsibility’ is often used, and nowadays many companies have strong corporate social responsibility programmes designed to help create a prosperous, inclusive society.
	Now I’ll look at some basic ethical considerations that a company needs to address. The first area is how the company treats its employees. All employees should be treated fairly and with respect. A company that cares for its workers’ welfare will tend to have a happier workforce and a lower turnover of staff. It is also important that workers are recruited on a basis of equal opportunity. The second area is how a company conducts its day-to-day business. In a manufacturing business, this includes how suppliers of raw materials are chosen and treated. A good example of this is the Fair Trade movement. This initiative ensures that small-scale farmers are paid directly and at a fair price for their crops. A company should also look at its policy on paying suppliers, and ensure that payments are made on time.
	Another ethical consideration is the impact the business has on the environment. Manufacturing companies should strive to ensure that production is clean and careful, and look for ways to minimize energy consumption and waste products. Finally, a company can also decide to give something back to the community it operates in. This can be in the form of ‘corporate giving’ programmes, where donations are given to community projects, or by initiating schemes to improve the local community and encouraging employees to work on these schemes.
	Sample Answer : The lecture is about business ethics, the primary goal of the company may be to make money, but it also recognises the responsibility towards the society. Many companies have strong corporate social responsibility programmes designed to help create a prosperous, inclusive society. The speaker talks about basic ethical considerations that a company needs to address, in which he talks about company’s treatment with its employees. Second area is how a company conducts its day-to-day business. Another ethical consideration is the impact the business has on the environment.</transcript>

    <transcript>Stewart’s company, MarthaStewart Omnimedia, is described as a ‘lifestyle media and merchandising giant’, producing everything from books and magazines to TV programmes, garden furniture, towels, kitchen equipment  … pretty much everything you could need to make your dream home, and pretty much all sold using Martha Stewart’s name.
	Now, as we’ve reported recently, shares in Martha Stewart Omnimedia have fallen dramatically since her conviction and many analysts are convinced that, if the company is to survive, a name change is inevitable. I’m joined here by Professor 
	Dave Spader. Dave, do you think there’s any future for the Martha Stewart brand? 
	D:Well, that’s the big question. As you say, the share price has fallen dramatically and that’s not good news for any company. The company’s own research says that 70%
	of their consumers think they should keep the Martha Stewart name but at the same time advertisers are keeping away from the company’s magazines.Advertising in the Martha Stewart Living magazine is down 35%. I think what’s happening is that they’re keeping the name but playing it down and putting the emphasis on other things. For example, one of their newest magazines, ‘Everyday Food’, no longer has ‘From the Kitchens of Martha Stewart Living’ on its cover. Things like that. Publicly, they’re saying they’ll stick with the name but I think we’ll continue to see Stewart’s name fade from view somewhat. Whether they’ll get rid of her name altogether I think it’s too early to say. 
	P:Are there other examples of brands changing names to survive this kind of bad publicity? 
	D:Oh, several. Philip Morris, the cigarette company, has recently become Altria and,in America, Esson became Exxon. But they were both parent companies changing their names, and I don’t think we can make direct comparisons with the Martha Stewart brand where she really is – or perhaps I should say was – the public face of the brand.

    <transcript>Scientific breakthrough, the kind that can potentially save lives, can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover, in the evolved, accumulated body of human anecdote, for example, or in the time-tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation, but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence, isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do, the results will often surprise.
	Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years, unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see.
	Sample Answer : The speaker I talking about the Science starting with observation, but there is a need to identify the patterns and signatures which can otherwise be dismissed or isolated. Western Australia had a problem with shark attacks over the last three years and it is escalating worldwide. Shark Attack Mitigation Systems and University of Western Australia Oceans Institute collaboratively made an announcement to reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see.</transcript>

    <transcript>Interviewer:  How important is motivation for a manager?
	Professor:  Oh, motivation is extremely important. I’d say it’s the most important aspect of a
	manager’s job. A manager’s job is to get the job done, whatever that job might be. So a
	manager has to motivate the workers, both as a team and also on an individual basis.
	Without motivation, the job just won’t get done.
	Interviewer:  So how do managers go about doing this? It doesn’t sound very easy.
	Professor:  No, it is a complicated issue. But managers have special tools. They are trained to use them to boost motivation and increase production to a maximum.
	Interviewer:  Tools?
	Professor:  Yes, tools like praise, approval and recognition. And then there is trust and
	expectation. They are all important for workers.
	Interviewer:  And money? What about money?
	Professor:  Yes, money is a factor but you might be surprised to learn that it comes out last on the list of these tools that we are talking about.
	Interviewer:  So, what comes before money? What sort of things are more important for workers?
	Professor:  Well, all of the things that I have already mentioned, and then job enrichment and good communication between the workers and the bosses.
	Interviewer:  And have you got any examples of real life situations to back up your claims?
	Professor:  One good example is the firm Western Electric. When managers started taking an
	interest in their workers, there was a huge increase in production. They started to talk
	to the workers and encouraged them to get involved in decision-making. Workers
	began to feel that their contributions were important. And it paid off.
	Interviewer:  Productivity increased?
	Professor:  Yes, hugely. 
	Sample Answer : As per the professor, motivation is extremely important. So a manager has to motivate the workers in a team and also on an individual basis. Managers are trained to boost motivation and increase production to a maximum. Moreover, money is a important factor but surprisingly it comes out last on the list. Job enrichment and good communication between the workers and the bosses is more important. One good example is the firm Western Electric. When managers started taking an interest in their workers, there was a huge increase in production.</transcript>

    <transcript>EBay is an enormously successful company; it’s a household word in several countries; in 2005 it had a turnover of $4.55 billion and it employed 11,600 people - it’s achieved all of this in just 11 years. What’s the secret of eBay’s success? I think the key issue here is that eBay couldn’t exist without the internet. You know, there aren’t many examples of companies like this - take Amazon, for example. If you don’t feel like switching your computer on you can always go round to the nearest bookshop. But if you want to sell your old magazines to somebody in Germany, eBay’s the only way to do it. Without the net’s ability to bring buyers and sellers together from different locations there would be no eBay. So this is big point number one. Now, let’s move on to point two, the founders of eBay. Meg Whitman, the CEO, like all of the senior staff already had a successful business background - she brought in an experienced
	management team. They had a great idea but it had to be a great profitable idea.  Around this - the importance of profitability - they built their business model. Let’s move on to point three, sound business management. Did you hear of eBay during the dotcom boom years? Not a lot - they were busy building their customer base and making money, they didn’t feature in stories headlining the excesses of the dotcom boom years ... Actually, I’ll add another point, point four. eBay doesn’t produce, sell or ship anything itself, it provides the online marketplace for other people to do this. This gives it enormous financial power

    <description>South Africa can make the rare claim of being host to two celebrated capes within a short distance of each other. The Cape of Good Hope is, of course, the point to the dagger that hangs from Cape Town’s belt. The Cape Peninsula forges south for 32 miles, fine terrain for a drive through seaside enclaves Fish Hoek and Simon’s Town, whales visible in False Bay, Diaz Beach waiting at the end. </description>

    <description>A cape can stare up as well as downwards. The North Cape Nordkapp juts into the Barents Sea at 71 degrees north, drawing continental Norway to a close via a sheer cliff. It is touted as Europe’s northernmost spot - with caveats. The first is that Knivskjellodden Point, due west, ebbs a mile farther north.</description>

    <description>Not a sharp needle of a landmark, more a swell on Australia’s south coast, Cape Otway is none the less a key episode in one of the great travel adventures. It is roughly the mid-moment of the Great Ocean Road, which runs for 151 miles along the lower edge of the state of Victoria, passing the limestone shards of the Twelve Apostles en route. </description>

    <description>James Cook was also behind the name of the rugged protrusion that forms the northernmost point of the Australian mainland - although there is far more drama to this lonely conclusion to a continent than a loose connection to an 18th-century Duke of York. Crowning the 410-mile Cape York Peninsula of upper Queensland, it thrusts a bony finger into the Coral Sea.</description>

    <transcript>"Communitas." Communitas is a fancy social science way of saying "spirit of community." And in visiting over 80 different communities, my measure of communitas became: How frequently did residents eat together? While it's completely up to each group how frequently they have common meals, I know some that have eaten together every single night for the past 40 years. I know others that have an occasional potluck once or twice a month. And from my observations, I can tell you, those that eat together more frequently, exhibit higher levels of communitas. It turns out, when you eat together, you start planning more activities together. When you eat together, you share more things. You start to watch each other's kids. You lend our your power tools. You borrow each other's cars.
	And despite all this, as my daughter loves to say, everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing, and I'm not best friends with every single person in my community. We even have differences and conflicts. But living in cohousing, we're intentional about our relationships. We're motivated to resolve our differences. We follow up, we check in, we speak our personal truths and, when appropriate, we apologize.
	Skeptics will say that cohousing is only interesting or attractive to a very small group of people. And I'll agree with that. If you look at Western cultures around the globe, those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent. But that needs to change, because our very lives depend upon it.
	Sample Answer : The speaker talks about Communitas. The speaker visited over 80 different communities to know How frequently did residents eat together?  And its up to each group as some are frequent and some are having an occasional potluck once or twice a month. The speaker talks about his daughter who says that you cannot be best friend with every single person in the community because it has differences and conflicts. But living in cohousing motivates to resolve the differences. But on the other hand, in western cultures those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent.</transcript>

    <transcript>Twenty-six thousand foreign exchange students are in American high schools this year. A few days ago, we asked four teenagers who arrived in August to discuss their experience so far. All but one are attending public schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, outside Washington.
	Johanna is from Germany.
	JOHANNA: "The biggest difference for me is the relationship to the teachers. Because here the teachers are more friends, and in Germany they are more like parents and strict and stuff like that."
	Another difference? In American high schools, the students are usually the ones who change rooms. Johanna and Daniel come from schools where the teachers change classrooms.
	DANIEL: "In Austria, it's more like you have all classes together with the same group of people. And so you are really good friends with like all the people you're in class with, because you know them since like four years and you have all classes together with them."
	Hande from Turkey is living with a host family in Denver, Colorado. She says students in Turkish schools have less choice.
	HANDE: "You cannot choose your own classes. And you don't have the right to drop out of one of them."
	She says Turkish schools are also more formal.
	HANDE: "When a teacher comes into the class you have to stand up and greet the teacher. He or she says good morning or good afternoon or something like that and you all, as a class, you answer. We don't do this in class here."
	How does the education compare? Hande is in three Advanced Placement classes, which are meant to prepare students for college.
	HANDE: "A.P. courses are really hard and they really force you to learn and are really good. But the regular classes, their level is lower than in Turkey."
	Rosa is from a country where high school is five years, not four like in America.
	ROSA: "In Italy we go to school only during the morning and just like for lessons. And Italian schools [don't] have like other activities. And whatever we want to do, it's outside the school or on our own or like private school or association outside."
	On the other hand, she says, having to go elsewhere for activities is not necessarily a bad thing.
	ROSA: "We in Italy, or in Europe, I think, we have a more free environment, if I can say this, because we are in touch with a lot of different things that are outside the school. It's like an American school could be a protective box."
	Sample Answer : The lecture is about foreign exchange students exchange program and he talks about the experience of teenagers from different countries attending public schools of Virginia, outside Washington. He talks about Johanna from Germany who says that teachers of Germany are more friendly. Daniel is from Austria and comes from schools where the teachers change classrooms. Moreover, Hande from Turkey, living with a host family in Denver, Colorado, says students in Turkish schools have less choice. Rosa is from a country where high school is five years, not four like in America.</transcript>

    <transcript>A worldwide study has found that almost twenty-five percent of wild mammals are in danger of permanently disappearing. Scientific researchers considered all known mammal populations. The researchers say permanent disappearance threatens at least one thousand one hundred forty-one species or groups of animals. Mammals are the closest relatives to human beings.
	The researchers are blaming loss of habitat, or living space, and hunting for threatened land mammals. They say water mammals suffer more from pollution, being hit by ships and caught in fishing nets.
	One thousand seven hundred experts worked on the study. They are from one hundred thirty countries. Their findings were reported at the World Conservation Conference of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Barcelona, Spain.
	The report was presented in connection with the Red List of Threatened Species. The World Conservation Conference announces the Red List each year. The list contains almost forty five thousand animals and plants. Of those, almost seventeen thousand, or about thirty eight percent, are threatened with extinction.
	Some scientists say the report provides evidence that Earth's wildlife is going through widespread extinction. The last such period may have taken place millions of years ago, when dinosaurs became extinct.
	Sample Answer : As per the lecture 25% of wild mammals are in danger of permanently disappearing which includes all known mammal populations, threatening at least one thousand one hundred forty-one species or groups of animals and most of them are mammals. The reason behind it is loss of habitat and pollution. As per the report Red List of Threatened Species foseventeen thousand, or about thirty eight percent, are threatened with extinction. The speaker talks about dinosaur getting extinct.</transcript>

    <description>Written into the cinematic lexicon as the title of two chilling movies, Cape Fear is very much real. A section of the North Carolina shore, it bulges into the Atlantic amid the vicious currents of Frying Pan Shoals. But for all its image, it - and Bald Head Island, on which it sits - is a place of beauty and tranquillity. </description>

    <description>Also known as Cape Palascia, Italy’s easternmost extremity clings to a route less driven - the ragged flank of southerly Puglia. Capo d’Otranto is a version of the country removed from the crowds of Rome and Venice - a rocky elbow where the Adriatic Sea greets its Ionian counterpart, a pale 1867 lighthouse monitoring this conversation.</description>

    <description>The Taj Mahal, on the outskirts of Agra, is the most famous building in the world - and arguably the most beautiful. The architecture is sublime but it is the story the stones embody that draws eight million visitors each year. It is a monument to the great love between the Mughal emperor Shah Jehan and his queen, Mumtaz Mahal.</description>

    <transcript>A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life.
	There are a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!
	Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
	I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel? No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful.
	Sample Answer : The lecture describes that few years ago; the speaker was stuck in a rut, so he decided to follow the footsteps of American philosopher and try something new for 30 days that is think about something that you have always wanted to add to your life. This challenge grew his self-confidence. He figured out that if you really want something badly, you can do anything for it.</transcript>

    <transcript>The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted. And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years.
	I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years. To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart. Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with. Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it.
	When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action. We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. It's like the canary in the coalmine. If they disappear, so do we. It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it.
	Sample Answer : The speaker talks about the process of pollination in which bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies co-evolved over 50 million years. The speaker tells that he has been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years and it fills him with wonder after watching beauty and seduction. He believes that it is a nature’s tool for survival.</transcript>

    <transcript>Solar power technology could help to reduce deaths caused by household pollution.
	Pollution trapped inside homes and other buildings kills more than 4 million people each year. Most of these deaths are in the developing world, mainly in Africa. Many people die as a result of breathing smoke or from cooking over wood- or coal-powered stoves. One way to reduce the number of deaths is through cooking equipment powered by the sun.
	Solar cookers work by reflecting light from the sun off large mirrors. The mirrors direct the light at a cooking pan. Then the light heats the pan with solar energy. 
	At SunFire’s office in Johannesburg, reflected sunlight heated up a cooking pan. Within two minutes, the pan was hot enough to cook sausages and onions.
	Crosby Menzies said the solar cooker can boil water in just four minutes. That is as fast as cooking with natural gas or electricity.
	He said the cooker is also much “friendlier” than other models because people do not have to stand in the sun to use it. The Sol-4 lets users cook in partial sunlight as long as the mirrors are positioned in the sun.
	Menzies said SunFire has sold hundreds of the solar cookers in South Africa. He said the company is exploring new projects in Mali, Ethiopia and Uganda. He added that many people do not believe that solar cookers will work until they see the cooking results with their own eyes. Menzies noted that people can prepare meals without having to collect firewood or spend money on coal. Such individuals would be less likely to develop breathing disorders from harmful smoke.
	At present, the cooker only works when the sun is shining. But engineers are working on a way to make it work without sunlight.
	Sample Answer :  As per the speaker pollution inside homes kill more than 4 million people each year and one way to reduce the number of deaths is solar cooker which works by reflecting light from the sun. Individuals using solar power would be less likely to develop breathing disorders from harmful smoke. However, the drawback is the cooker only works when the sun is shining. But engineers are working to make it work without sunlight.</transcript>

We have estimated that roughly a third of China’s corporate debt is related to the booming construction and real-estate sectors.</description>

    <transcript>Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital. The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
	On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretroviral. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
	After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people. They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid. Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
	Sample Answer : The speaker talks about patient capital. The critics point the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 just to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, investment and so on but we just have environmental degradation, poverty and rampant corruption.  The solution for all these problems which speaker talks about is navigating markets daily, making micro-decision and we need both market and aid.</transcript>

    <transcript>The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out.
	Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study.
	Sample Answer : The speaker is talking about the development of human’s adult life. In the past, Harvard study of Adult Development dis research on 724 men in which they talked to them about their work aand home lives. The speaker consider it to be rare as most of the people drop out from such year after year studies, even researchers either die or get distracted. But this study survived because of luck and persistence.</transcript>

    <transcript>Imagine that when you walked in here this evening, you discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same: ageless, race less, generically good-looking. That person sitting right next to you might have the most idiosyncratic inner life, but you don't have a clue because we're all wearing the same blank expression all the time. That is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities, only it applies to buildings, not people.
	Cities are full of roughness and shadow, texture and color. You can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character in apartment buildings in Riga and Yemen, social housing in Vienna, Hopi villages in Arizona, brownstones in New York, and wooden houses in San Francisco. These aren't palaces or cathedrals. These are just ordinary residences expressing the ordinary splendor of cities. And the reason they're like that is that the need for shelter is so bound up with the human desire for beauty. Their rough surfaces give us a touchable city. Right? Streets that you can read by running your fingers over brick and stone.
	But that's getting harder to do, because cities are becoming smooth. New downtowns sprout towers that are almost always made of concrete and steel and covered in glass. You can look at skylines all over the world -- Houston, Guangzhou, and Frankfurt -- and you see the same army of high-gloss robots marching over the horizon. Now, just think of everything we lose when architects stop using the full range of available materials. When we reject granite and limestone and sandstone and wood and copper and terra-cotta and brick and wattle and plaster, we simplify architecture and we impoverish cities.
	Sample Answer : The lecture is about creepy transformation which applies to buildings.  Cities are full of roughness and shadow, texture and color. There are many examples of architectural surfaces of great individuality and character in apartment buildings in Riga and Yemen, Hopi villages in Arizona, whereas, new downtown towers made of concrete and steel and covered in glass such as skylines in Houston and Frankfurt.</transcript>

    <transcript>In the Egyptian revolution, the Revolution 2.0, everyone has contributed something, small or big. They contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. If you look at the scene, Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill. Everything was going bad. Everything was going wrong. We only ranked high when it comes to poverty, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, lack of political activism. Those were the achievements of our great regime. Yet, nothing was happening. And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. In fact, people were extremely frustrated. But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. Everyone was scared. Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave -- going into protests as a couple of hundred, getting beaten up and arrested. But in fact, the majority was scared. Everyone did not want really to get in trouble.
	Sample Answer : Egyptian revolution, has contributed something to bring us the most inspiring story in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It shows that Egypt for 30 years had been in a downhill in which everything was going bad. They only ranked high when it comes to poverty, corruption, lack of freedom of speech and these were the achievements of their great regime.</transcript>

    <transcript>Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 190 heads of state -- nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats -- tops out at 15, 16 percent. The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent.
	We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting -- it's about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?" And he said, "No, we've been here about a year." And I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?" And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."  So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying, I talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because I really think that's the answer.
	Sample Answer : The speaker talks about women not getting top position whether it is parliament, C- level jobs or board seats. The percentage of the women being at the top is only 20%. The another problem is making choices between professional success personal fulfillment. The speaker talks about the company where is was pitching a deal where there was no woman room. She focuses on changing these numbers by keeping women in the workforce.</transcript>

    <transcript>Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses? -- the microwave oven. 
	Now, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity. But this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day. Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations, and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate. 
	So what does this mean for the future of work? The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question: To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations? On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter. Today they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases. Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. Accountants and lawyers are still needed. They're going to be needed for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation. But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. 
	Now, as mentioned, machines are not making progress on novel situations. The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention. It has to stand out from the crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps in the market, things that nobody else is doing. It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy.
	Sample Answer : The physicist is talking about electromagnetic radiation used for cooking and gave an invention of the microwave oven. He further talks about machines getting smarter and smarter as they grade essays or diagnose diseases. But machines will shrink their ranks as they are not making progress. The marketing campaigns have to be changed which are created by humans.</transcript>

As per the study, women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce whereas the boys or men are even negotiating their first salary, the percentage is 57 and only seven percent of women negotiate their salary. And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. What the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women.
