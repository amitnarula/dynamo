    <description>Earth’s rigid outer shell is made up of vast rocky pieces called tectonic plates. These plates move as slowly as fingernails grow.

This sends stored‐up energy surging through Earth. This energy is what causes earthquakes.</description>

    <description>While Europeans were in the midst of the Dark Ages, Mayans never stopped learning. They tried out new farming methods. They rotated their crops so the soil would last longer. They only farmed crops on the same field once every three years or so. Turkey and ducks were tamed and kept on Mayan farms. That way, Mayans wouldn’t have to worry about hunting or trapping food.</description>

    <description>High up in the Andes Mountains, the Incas built suspension bridges out of braids of vine and rope. These bridges were very strong. One bridge built over a deep river valley above the river Apurimac lasted for 500 years! Famous examples of suspension bridges today are the San Francisco Bay Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. But the Incan bridges were the first suspension bridges in the world!</description>

    <description>Bamboo represents values and qualities the literati admired in nature. It is supple and graceful, but also tough and unbreakable. Like a pine tree, it is an evergreen, which means it thrives in the winter. In Chinese, the word for “node” (a bump on a branch) or “joining point” sounds just like the word for “integrity,” and bamboo has many nodes.</description>

A recent example is one suggesting that a new force of nature might have been discovered. If true, that would mean that we have to rewrite the textbooks.</description>

And now the world’s most populous nation is pledging to cut the carbon intensity of its economy nearly in half by the end of the decade, by becoming more energy efficient. But Dabo Guan, an economist with the University of East Anglia says rapid growth in China means carbon emissions will still keep rising.</description>

    <transcript>The diagram differentiates between food eaten during frontier days and today. During frontier days people preferred hard track food along with cow or goat milk, open range meat whereas today people choose to eat fast food, ice cream and domesticated meats. In past people were dependent on spring water and homegrown veggies but today's population depends on city water and supermarket veggies along with pancakes and chocolate compared to Johny cakes and chicken fried Armadillos. However, the things prioritized by both are butter, bread, spices, berries and baking soda.</transcript>

    <transcript>The lecture is on Tapirs which are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon but their habitat is being destroyed as they are hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution. This is unfortunate as Tapirs play the major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest as being herbivores by nature they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. So the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole.</transcript>
