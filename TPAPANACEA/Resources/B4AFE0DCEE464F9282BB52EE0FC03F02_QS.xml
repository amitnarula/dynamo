This sends stored‐up energy surging through Earth. This energy is what causes earthquakes.</description>

	<transcript>"Doping" is the general term for the use of banned substances or practices to improve athletic performance. The World Anti-Doping Agency says the term probably came from the Dutch word "dop." That was the name for an alcoholic drink used by Zulu fighters in Africa to improve their performance in battle.
The agency says the word doping began to be used for athletes in the beginning of the twentieth century. At first, it meant the illegal drugging of racehorses.
The agency notes that athletes have used substances for centuries to improve their performance. Ancient Greeks used special foods and drinks. Nineteenth century cyclists and others used alcohol, caffeine, cocaine -- even strychnine, a strong poison. By the nineteen twenties, sports organizations were attempting to stop the use of doping substances. But at the time they lacked scientific ways to test for them.

	<transcript>Two hundred years of modern science. We have to admit that our performance is not great. The machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures. The houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes. But we shouldn't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason: they didn't have much time. Two hundred years is not a lot of time, while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials, that we wish we had in our possession. Remember, these materials carry a quality assurance of three billion years.
Take, for example, sequoia trees. They carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years in cold weather, in warm climates, UV light. Yet, if you look at the structure by high-resolution electron microscopy, and you ask yourself, what is it made of, surprisingly, it's made of sugar. Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.It's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose. And this nanocrystalline cellulose is so strong, on a weight basis, it's about 10 times stronger than steel. Yet it's made of sugar. So scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry.

	<transcript>We are stealing nature from our children. Now, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve, although that is unfortunately also the case. What I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way that's so purist and so strict that under the definition we're creating for ourselves, there won't be any nature left for our children when they're adults. But there's a fix for this. So let me explain.
Right now, humans use half of the world to live, to grow their crops and their timber, to pasture their animals. If you added up all the human beings, we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together. We cut roads through the forest. We have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches. We've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers. And of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air. So when you take your next breath, you'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in 1750. So all of these changes, and many others, have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene." And this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch, given how pervasive human influence has been over it. Now, it's still just a proposed epoch, but I think it's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.

    <description>While Europeans were in the midst of the Dark Ages, Mayans never stopped learning. They tried out new farming methods. They rotated their crops so the soil would last longer. They only farmed crops on the same field once every three years or so. Turkey and ducks were tamed and kept on Mayan farms. That way, Mayans wouldn’t have to worry about hunting or trapping food.</description>

    <description>High up in the Andes Mountains, the Incas built suspension bridges out of braids of vine and rope. These bridges were very strong. One bridge built over a deep river valley above the river Apurimac lasted for 500 years! Famous examples of suspension bridges today are the San Francisco Bay Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. But the Incan bridges were the first suspension bridges in the world!</description>

    <description>Bamboo represents values and qualities the literati admired in nature. It is supple and graceful, but also tough and unbreakable. Like a pine tree, it is an evergreen, which means it thrives in the winter. In Chinese, the word for “node” (a bump on a branch) or “joining point” sounds just like the word for “integrity,” and bamboo has many nodes.</description>

    <description>Thus people who are interested in serious science should be extremely cautious when they read an online story that purports to be a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery. A recent example is one suggesting that a new force of nature might have been discovered. If true, that would mean that we have to rewrite the textbooks.</description>

And now the world’s most populous nation is pledging to cut the carbon intensity of its economy nearly in half by the end of the decade, by becoming more energy efficient. But Dabo Guan, an economist with the University of East Anglia says rapid growth in China means carbon emissions will still keep rising.</description>

    <transcript>The diagram differentiates between food eaten during frontier days and today. During frontier days people preferred hard track food along with cow or goat milk, open range meat whereas today people choose to eat fast food, ice cream and domesticated meats. In past people were dependent on spring water and homegrown veggies but today's population depends on city water and supermarket veggies along with pancakes and chocolate compared to Johny cakes and chicken fried Armadillos. However, the things prioritized by both are butter, bread, spices, berries and baking soda.</transcript>

    <transcript>The lecture is on Tapirs which are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon but their habitat is being destroyed as they are hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution. This is unfortunate as Tapirs play the major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest as being herbivores by nature they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. So the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole.</transcript>

    <description>The theory invented by the Irvine group is really quite exotic. They start with the very reasonable premise that the possible new particle is something that is not described by existing theory. This makes sense because the possible new particle is very low mass and would have been discovered before if it were governed by known physics.</description>

    <description>Wise men and philosophers throughout the ages have disagreed on many things, but many are in unanimous agreement on one point: "We become what we think about." Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "A man is what he thinks about all day long." The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius put it this way: "A man's life is what his thoughts make of it." In the Bible we find: "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he."</description>

    <transcript>A few months later, I heard that Eldar Shafir, a professor at Princeton University and one of the authors of this study, was coming over to Holland, where I live. So we met up in Amsterdam to talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty. And I can sum it up in just two words: scarcity mentality. It turns out that people behave differently when they perceive a thing to be scarce. And what that thing is doesn't much matter -- whether it's not enough time, money or food.
You all know this feeling, when you've got too much to do, or when you've put off breaking for lunch and your blood sugar takes a dive. This narrows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sandwich you've got to have now, the meeting that's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow. So the long-term perspective goes out the window. You could compare it to a new computer that's running 10 heavy programs at once. It gets slower and slower, making errors. Eventually, it freezes -- not because it's a bad computer, but because it has too much to do at once. The poor have the same problem. They're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb, but because they're living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions.
So suddenly I understood why so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work. Investments in education, for example, are often completely ineffective. Poverty is not a lack of knowledge. A recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money-management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all.

    <!-- <answer>The lecture is based on global food and agriculture surging demand surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food. This means that supply can no longer keep up with demand despite exploding prices. People could starve and governments may fall.  The speaker realizes from the research data was being used to make critical decisions. This is how speaker started with the Gro Intelligence, its main motive is to empower decision-makers at every level and how how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis.</answer> -->

    <!-- <transcript>We could have a tipping point in global food and agriculture if surging demand surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food. This means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand despite exploding prices, unless we can commit to some type of structural change. This time around, it won't be about stock markets and money. It's about people. People could starve and governments may fall. This question of at what point does supply struggle to keep up with surging demand is one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading and became an absolute obsession. It went from interest to obsession when I realized through my research how broken the system was and how very little data was being used to make such critical decisions. That's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street and start an entrepreneurial journey to start Gro Intelligence. -->
<!-- At Gro, we focus on bringing this data and doing the work to make it actionable, to empower decision-makers at every level. But doing this work, we also realized that the world, not just world leaders, but businesses and citizens like every single person in this room, lacked an actionable guide on how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis. And so we built a model, leveraging the petabytes of data we sit on, and we solved for the tipping point. -->
<!-- Now, no one knows we've been working on this problem and this is the first time that I'm sharing what we discovered. We discovered that the tipping point is actually a decade from now. We discovered that the world will be short 214 trillion calories by 2027. The world is not in a position to fill this gap. -->

    <answer>There is always a hard choice person faces while choosing between two careers,  places to live or whom to marry and many more. Hard choices seem be agonizing, hand-wringing or  the gnashing of teeth. But speaker thinks that understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses. Alternatives make the choices hard, alternative is better in some ways or other.</answer>

    <transcript>Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future. It might be between two careers -- artist and accountant -- or places to live -- the city or the country -- or even between two people to marry -- you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita. Or it might be a choice about whether to have children, to have an ailing parent move in with you, to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold. Or whether to donate your life savings to charity.
Chances are, the hard choice you thought of was something big, something momentous, something that matters to you. Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing, hand-wringing, the gnashing of teeth. But I think we've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives. Understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses.
What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate. In any easy choice, one alternative is better than the other. In a hard choice, one alternative is better in some ways, the other alternative is better in other ways, and neither is better than the other overall. You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country, because staying is better in some ways, moving is better in others, and neither is better than the other overall.</transcript>

    <transcript>Energy from the Sun reaches the Earth as heat and some is radiated into space, while some of it is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and reflected back to Earth. This is a natural process, one of the main greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, and extra quantity of this is released into the atmosphere.  Plants are serving to remove some of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by absorbing it through their leaves. </transcript>

    <transcript>the Pan-African economy is booming. Combined GDP is already over two trillion dollars. This is a massive commercial and social opportunity, not a helpless continent. So why isn't there already something better? Around the world, automotive is quarter the manufacturing sector. But in Africa, it's generally been overlooked by carmakers, who are focused on larger, established markets and emerging economies like India and China. This lack of industrialization, which itself creates a vicious-cycle barrier to the emergence of industry, has caused the dependence on imports. There is a supply-demand disconnect, with the vast majority of automotive spending on the continent today, essentially funding an international network of car exporters instead of fueling the growth of local industry.
It's entirely possible to solve this disconnect, though, starting with products that people actually want.</transcript>

    <transcript>I want to talk to you about the future of medicine. But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past. Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine, we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model. In fact, the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words: have disease, take pill, kill something.
Now, the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution. Many of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States. But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative. Here you had a chemical, either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory, and it would course through your body, it would find its target, lock into its target -- a microbe or some part of a microbe -- and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity. And you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease -- a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis -- and transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness. You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease.

    <transcript>For as long as I remember, I've loved mathematics. Actually, it's not 100 percent true. I've loved mathematics for all but a two-week period in senior high school.
I was top of my class, and we were about to start the Extension Maths course. I was really excited about this brand new topic coming up, complex numbers. I like complex. My teacher was priming us for the concepts with some questions about square roots. Square of nine -- three; square of 256 -- sixteen. Too easy. Then she asked the trick question: What about the square root of negative one? Of course, we were all over it -- "Come on, Miss! We all know you can't take the square root of a negative." "That's true in the real world," she said. "But in the complex world, the square root of negative one is the imaginary number i."
That day, my entire mathematical world came crashing down on me.
"Imaginary numbers? Seriously? But mathematics is a source of truth, please don't go abstract on me. I would have studied art if I wanted to play with imaginary numbers."
"This is Extension Maths, let's get back with our program!" She didn't, and over the next couple of weeks, I reluctantly performed meaningless calculations, finding imaginary solutions to quadratic equations.
But then something amazing happened. We began finding elegant solutions to real-world problems we previously had no answers to, starting with the complex world of imaginary numbers. So some mathematician 500 years ago decides to have some fun and make up these imaginary numbers, and because of that we can now derive these amazing identities with applications in the real world, in fields like electrical engineering. Wow! I gained a whole new level of appreciation for mathematics. And after my brief mistrust, I was now in love with the subject more than ever.

    <description>The theory invented by the Irvine group is really quite exotic. They start with the very reasonable premise that the possible new particle is something that is not described by existing theory. This makes sense because the possible new particle is very low mass and would have been discovered before if it were governed by known physics.</description>

    <description>Wise men and philosophers throughout the ages have disagreed on many things, but many are in unanimous agreement on one point: "We become what we think about." Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "A man is what he thinks about all day long." The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius put it this way: "A man's life is what his thoughts make of it." In the Bible we find: "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he."</description>

    <transcript>What is an elector? Well, an elector is a person - a member of a political party - who has been chosen by that party in a given state. OK, so this person, this elector, is pledged to his or her party's candidate for president. So in any state there are several electors. The number of electors in a state is equal to the number of U.S. Senators plus the number of U.S. Representatives in that state. Don't get confused here. The senators and representatives are not the same people as the electors. It's just that the numbers are the same. So . . . there are always two senators in each state, as you know, but the number of representatives depends on the population of the state. So a populous state has several representatives and a state without a lot of people will have only a few representatives.</transcript>

    <answer>The images that come to our mind while thinking about climate change are retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs not the giant insects and erupting volcanoes. Perhaps, we should start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air. Climate change reflects our decisions as individuals, as governments and as industries. The speaker says that along with changes in climate it still persists and may support a life which we may not recognize. The speaker emphasizes on the invisible changes of which humans are leaving a vibrant trace in the air.

    <transcript>When we think about climate change, we probably don't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes or funny voices. The images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs. We think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
But perhaps it's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air. Like air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule, the breath and the planet. It's immediate, vital and intimate, as well as being amorphous and cumbersome. And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
Climate change is the collective self-portrait of humanity. It reflects our decisions as individuals, as governments and as industries. And if there's anything I've learned from looking at air, it's that even though it's changing, it persists. It may not support the kind of life that we'd recognize, but it will support something. And if we humans are such a vital part of that change, I think it's important that we can feel the discussion. Because even though it's invisible, humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air.</transcript>

    <answer>The speaker talks about the Arcus Center, the building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and would create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice. The students wanted a place for cultural exchange where they can welcome the outside community. So the space was designed in the middle of the Arcus Center which has fireplace and a kitchen. The central space works for big social gatherings and a place to meet one-on-one for the  
very first time, it’s like three-way intersection that encourages people to start a conversation. The building is made of cordwood masonry and is super low-tech, made for social activity.</answer>

They asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and in doing so, create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice. The students wanted a place for cultural exchange. They thought a place for preparing food together could do that. And they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community. They thought a fireplace could draw people in and help start conversations. And everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world. There really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space, so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses. Community meeting houses are places where there's very specific relationships between people, like this one in Mali, where the elders gather. The low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye level. It's very egalitarian. I mean, you can't stand up and take over the meeting. You'd actually bump your head.
In meeting houses, there's always a central space where you can sit around a circle and see each other. So we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the Arcus Center, and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen. It's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes, but it was so important to the concept, we got it done. And now the central space works for big social gatherings and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time. It's almost like this three-way intersection that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation. Now you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on. You can sit by the fireplace and share stories. You can study together in big groups or in small ones, because the architecture sets up these opportunities.
Even the construction is about building relationships. It's made of cordwood masonry, which is using logs the way you would use bricks. It's super low-tech and easy to do and anyone can do it — and that's the entire point. The act of making is a social activity.</transcript>

      <transcript>The diagrams show Queen Mary Hospital at three different stages in its development. In 1960, the hospital was built close to a main road and next to a shopping centre. A large area behind the hospital was turned into a car park, while the area behind the shopping centre was farmland. By 1980, the shopping centre had been demolished in order to make way for two additional hospital buildings pharmacy and a cancer centre. Furthermore, the farmland was converted it into a nursing school. In 2000, the main hospital building remained unchanged but the cancer centre was extended to cover the entire nursing school and the original car park was further reduced and nursing school was built there.</transcript>

      <transcript>Ocean thermal energy conversion is a system that converts heat energy into the electric power using the temperature difference between surface seawater. The solar energy of the sun heats up the surface water and this warm water is introduced into the evacuated evaporation chamber, where it boils. As it boils, salt is deposited and water vapour is generated. This vapour then drives a turbine to generate electricity. After it powers the turbine, the water vapour enters the condensing chamber, which is cooled by the water from the depths of the ocean. The water vapour is condensed in this chamber, producing drinking water. Meanwhile, waste salt water is discharged into the ocean and the process can be repeated.</transcript>

    <transcript>The lecture is on interactions of ants in different environments and  these systems have in common is that there's no central control. An ant colony has sterile female workers, whom you see walking around and reproductive females who lay the eggs only and do not instruct inspite of being queens, So in an ant colony nobody is the incharge, and entire systems are regulated using very simple interactions. Ants interact using smell. They smell with their antennae. It doesn't matter which ant it meets because it’s not transmitting any kind of complicated message. All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants. A brain works in the same way, but the whole network of the ants can be seen.</transcript>

    <transcript>The lecture is based on Google which has to reveal how much they spend in managing data and how many data centers could they be building, because a big data center costs a certain amount of money. Even how much electricity they need, as to run the servers, certain amount is needed. Google is more efficient than most, but  still have some basic requirements. Maybe the power is proportional and with guesses the total amount of storage,  servers, drives per server can be calculated.</transcript>

Every month, 500 million consumers are buying things on mobile phones which is more than the total population of the United States, UK and Germany.  It took China less than five years to become a country of mobile commerce, and the two technology platforms, Alibaba and Tencent are the main reason behind it as they own 90 percent of the e-commerce of the whole market.</transcript>

    <transcript>Cryptocurrencies are digital money that isn't run by any government or bank. Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency, but there are hundreds of them.  And these things are real money. The sushi restaurant down my street takes Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography. Cryptography is the study of how to secure communication. Cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us. And it's so powerful that at times the US government has classified it as a weapon.</transcript>

    <description> The fact that Bonn today has become an insider tip on the international stage - especially in the area of sustainability - certainly originates from those roughly five decades when Bonn acted as capital city for the most successful democracy on German ground. It was this valuable heritage that Bonn could draw back on when the decision was taken in the Federal Republic of Germany to make Bonn Germany's United Nations City.</description>

    <description>Most transport businesses experience cash flow problems at one time or another. Often, the main problem is that they have to wait 30, 60 or 90 days before clients pay. On the other hand, the business has regular expenses such as fuel, repairs and driver wages. One way to solve this problem is to use debtor financing. </description>

The temporary housing we are able to offer now still has provisional character, but with some private space and independence. Also, we are managing to build more reasonably priced apartments, which we were already lacking before the refugees arrived in Bonn.</description>

    <description>Members of several opposition parties have chosen Adama Barrow to head a coalition to challenge Jammeh. The successful formation of a coalition and general endorsement of one candidate is a major step forward by the political opposition - after 15 years of trying. In addition, for the first time since his accession to power, Gambians have defied the brutal nature of President Jammeh's regime, overtly challenged him and called on him to reform the electoral system and institute democratic reforms.</description>
