      <transcript>Dinosaurs are vertebrates that range from reptile-like to bird-like. Dinosaurs dominated the terrestrial ecosystem for over 160 million years from around 230 million years ago until 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct. Dinosaurs still exist today in the line of birds (avian dinosaurs). Knowledge about dinosaurs comes from both fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. This shows that all land masses were at one time connected in a super continent, called Pangaea, due to the fact that numerous fossils of the same species have been found on completely different continents. Pangaea began to break up during the Triassic period around 230 million years ago. Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, their mounted, fossilized skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and blockbuster films such as Jurassic Park, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. The term is also used informally to describe any prehistoric reptile, such as the pelycosaur Dimetrodon, the winged pterosaurs, and the aquatic ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs, though none of these are dinosaurs.</transcript>

      <transcript>Walmart made a surprise announcement on Thursday that it would be raising wages of its half a million US workforce to $9 by this April, and then $10 by next February. In a press release, the world’s largest private employer said, “Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since it started and the company wants to ensure that this remains a vital part of the Walmart experience.” The company’s reputation has suffered serious blows for years now, for paying poverty level wages to its workers, ensuring that a very large fraction of them have to rely on government assistance to survive. Walmart has also faced scores of lawsuits for gender discrimination among other things. But in the past 2 years, union organizers have been working with some Walmart employees to agitate for better conditions and wages. The group Our Walmart, last November, led the first coordinated sit-ins at Walmart stores in the history of the company. And employees have also launched a number of one-day strikes and walkouts during busy shopping days such as Black Friday. So, does the new move to raise the base pay of Walmart workers mean the company has salvaged its ugly reputation?</transcript>

      <transcript>A company in the USA is paying its employees to sleep more. Staff at the insurance company Aetna will get $300 a year added to their salary if they get at least seven hours of sleep a night. That works out to just over an extra dollar for each night the employee sleeps over seven hours. The idea behind this scheme is employee performance. Human resources officials say employees will work better if they have slept well. They add that a workforce that is more awake and alert will mean the company will perform better. Staff can either record their sleep automatically using a wrist monitor that connects to Aetna's computers, or manually record how long they have slept every night. There are a number of studies that warn that not sleeping enough can affect our ability to do our job. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine said that the average worker in the USA loses 11.3 working days of productivity a year because of not getting enough sleep. This costs companies about $2,280 for one worker. It estimates that the US economy loses $63.2 billion a year because workers do not sleep more than seven hours a night. A 2015 study in Europe by the Rand Corporation found that staff who slept less than seven hours per night were far less productive than workers who had eight or more hours of sleep. The staff at Aetna also receive extra cash if they do exercise.</transcript>

      <description>From an anthropological point of view, carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended.[15] Winter was thought of as the reign of the winter spirits that were to be driven out for the summer to return. Carnival can thus be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to summer: a fertility celebration, the first spring festival of the new year.</description>

      <description>To say law enforcement is a difficult job would undoubtedly be an understatement. Unexpected, sometimes life-threatening, encounters with dangerous individuals are the foundation of a career whose primary purpose is to serve and protect the public. As a result, the police are currently given considerable leeway in their judgment of response to potential threats. </description>

      <description>How can we make sure that students are informed about what’s going on around the world? That they are armed with the tools to be able to distinguish between opinion and fact; between evidence-based statements and empty rhetoric; between sensationalism and solid journalism? Just like most other things in life, the best way to do all that is through practice.</description>

      <description>As a symbol, the heart captures the full range of human life and emotion: love and war, faith and religion, and heroism and power. But these complexities don’t come close to the organ itself. Each heart beats 42 million times a year, endlessly pumping blood through a network of arteries, veins and capillaries that, if lined up end-to-end, would circle the Earth 2½ times.</description>

      <transcript>Harries sees bamboo as a great building material. First, it is strong. The strength of at least three species of bamboo is similar to steel. Besides its strength, Harries says that bamboo has other features that make it a great building material. He says it is resilient, meaning it keeps its shape and strength even under pressure. "It's a remarkably strong material, remarkably resilient. It's optimized to be very tall. Obviously bamboo material, something like this, might grow 20 meters and it supports its own weight, and, of course, it also supports huge wind loads ..." Bamboo also grows quickly. Bamboo that is suitable for construction needs much less resources than wood. The harvest cycle of bamboo is about 3 years. Softwoods such as cedar, pine and spruce have a harvest cycle of about 10 years. And hardwoods that come from flowering plants such as oak, maple and walnut need more than 30 years.  Harries says bamboo poles could be joined together into columns for building floors and roofs. In many countries they are already used for wall panel structures. Bamboo is widely used as food for panda bears. It is also used for furniture or man-made building products such as flooring and window covers, or blinds. However, bamboo is not used much outside its native growing area. This is mostly because of its round shape. But there are other reasons too. Bamboo, it seems, has an image problem. People think – or have the mentality – that bamboo is a low quality building material. "It is viewed in much of the world as well, bamboo is for poor people, and so there's that mentality that we're trying to get over."</transcript>

      <transcript>After years of wrangling and debate and hemming and hawing, the federal communication commission finally decided to reclassify broadband, first of all as being fairly fast - basically the speed that lets you watch youtube videos - and that matters in terms of determining how much competition there is out there. If you classify broadband as being very slow, like DSL, then you can imagine that a lot of americans have choices. When they really don't. It makes sure that its very clear to congress, very clear to everyone who matters, that for most americans there really is no competition and no choice in broadband providers.  If we had real competition, we wouldn't need regulations like this necessarily because the company that cheated would get punished in the market (that's the theory anyway). But the most important reclassification is reclassifying broadband internet, high-speed internet like a common carrier, like the phone company. Phone companies don't favor one producer of voice signals over another. What we really needed was for the data flowing out of our walls to be treated the same way. So I think this is a major victory, one that I never would have predicted - I'm usually much more cynical about how all this stuff is gonna go down.</transcript>

      <transcript>Freedom of speech is protected in the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But universities across the U.S. are debating if they will tolerate all kind of speech on campus – even speech that students say is offensive, hateful or divisive. For example, in 2015 a University of Kansas professor almost lost her job after students complained that she used the racial slur known as the “n-word.” The word has historically been used in the U.S. to demean African-Americans. However, a four-month investigation showed the professor used the word not as an insult but as part of a discussion on race. At Yale University two professors, a husband and wife, both stepped down from their positions in May 2016. This came after students demanded they be removed for an email one of the professors sent to students. The email criticized the university administration for asking students to avoid wearing costumes that might be considered culturally insensitive for the holiday called Halloween. And in Illinois last year, Northwestern University investigated one of its professors after she wrote a controversial article for the Chronicle of Higher Education. In it, the professor criticized some universities’ new rules against sexual relationships between professors and students. She said the rules promoted an idea of professors as having nearly unlimited power over students. And, she said, the rules promoted an idea of students as victims. Those ideas, she said, create a feeling of extreme fear about sex. Students reacted strongly to the article. They said the professor’s words made them feel uncomfortable about reporting sexual misbehavior on campus. Eventually, the university announced the professor had not violated any law.</transcript>

      <description>How can we make sure that students are informed about what’s going on around the world? That they are armed with the tools to be able to distinguish between opinion and fact; between evidence-based statements and empty rhetoric; between sensationalism and solid journalism? Just like most other things in life, the best way to do all that is through practice.Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union abbreviated to USSR, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a recognized world superpower, and a rival to the United States which played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II.</description>

      <transcript>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by the British author J. K. Rowling. The books chronicle the adventures of the adolescent wizard Harry Potter and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's quandary involving the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents in his quest to conquer the wizarding world and subjugate non-magical people (Muggles). Since the June 30, 1997 release of the first novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, (retitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern for the increasingly dark tone. As of June 2008, the book series has sold more than 400 million copies and has been translated into 67 languages, and the last four books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history. A series of many genres, including fantasy and coming of age, it has many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death, although it is primarily considered to be a work of children's literature. There are also many other themes in the series, such as love and prejudice.</transcript>

      <transcript>Scientists have cast new light on why some men have deeper voices than others. It was traditionally thought that males developed a lower pitched voice to attract members of the opposite sex. However, anthropologists at the American college Penn State believe a deep voice was to scare off other males. Researcher David Puts said: "In humans, and possibly other primates too, a low pitched voice evolved primarily to intimidate other men…to make males seem bigger and scarier." He added that: "Human male traits imply physical aggression and formidability and seem to provide competitive advantages in fighting or threatening other men more than they help attract women." The researchers at Penn State recorded more than 500 men and women speaking. They then played the recordings back to more than 1,100 different people of both sexes. Male volunteers rated each male recording for levels of dominance they perceived in the voices. The same recordings were rated by 15 female volunteers for romantic attractiveness. Men similarly rated the women's voices for attractiveness. Most of the men thought the lower-pitched male recordings belonged to a more dominant man. Dr Puts said women also liked lower-pitched voices, but the pattern of the women's ratings did not lead him to say that the deepness of the male voice was so important to females.</transcript>

      <transcript>Science tells us that burning lots of fossil fuel and cutting down lots of trees is warming the Earth, but just how fast and where all the added heat is going has been unclear, though the oceans seem most likely. Now new research based on temperature readings taken over the past decade of the upper half of the seas, is bringing more clarity - and concern. It’s based on the international program called Argo that by 2004 had deployed some 3,500 robotic buoys measuring sea temperatures down to 6,000 feet. Dr. Paul Durack and his colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory compared the new Argo data with ocean models and satellite readings of the ocean surface. DURACK: So, what we actually did was we’re basically revisiting estimates of temperature changes in the ocean. And what we found was that there’s an underestimate of how the oceans are warming by a factor of 25 percent or more due to poor sampling of the southern hemisphere that this study has uncovered. So, it’s really not a small adjustment when we consider this analysis with the measurements of ocean warming.</transcript>

      <description>Unfortunately, the specific requirements of MSL made it difficult to depend on past experience. While NASA had constructed the biggest supersonic parachute ever made, parachuting was far from enough. Since the atmosphere of Mars is 100 times thinner than the atmosphere of Earth, the parachute alone could not reduce the speed of descent past 200 miles per hour—a breakneck speed that would surely damage Curiosity upon landing.</description>

      <description>During America’s early history as a nation, women were denied some of the key rights enjoyed by male citizens. For example, married women couldn’t own property and had no legal claim to any money they might earn, and no female had the right to vote. Women were expected to focus on housework and motherhood, not politics.</description>

      <description>In the years leading up to the American Revolution, both the British and the colonists used broadsides to influence public opinion. This broadside, “The Bostonian’s Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring &amp; Feathering,” printed in London in 1774, is a British depiction of the Bostonians’ treatment of a British customs officer, John Malcom.</description>

      <description>Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals.</description>

      <transcript>The Japanese games giant Nintendo has released an app that is taking the world by storm. The next big thing, and new Internet sensation, is an augmented reality game called Pokemon Go. Players must physically move around the real world in order to capture mystical creatures called Pokemon (short for pocket monsters). It was only officially released last week, in the USA, New Zealand and Australia. It is about to overtake Twitter in the number of daily active users and it hasn't even been launched globally yet. Analysts report that in just 48 hours, Go was installed on 5.6 per cent of all Android devices in the USA. On average, users are spending twice as much time on Go than on apps like Snapchat. Pokemon Go has already jumped to the top of the App Store and Google Play Store. It is also having an unprecedented social impact. Hackers have targeted illegal copies of the app to infect millions of smart phones. Other criminals have used the game to lure unsuspecting players to go to a location to collect a Pokemon character and then rob them or burgle their empty house. The app tracks your location via GPS as you walk around looking for Pokemon. The website PCmag.com advised: "Don't go walking around neighborhoods late at night for your Pokemon fix….If you can collect Pokemon…in public, crowded areas, we recommend doing that instead of shady spots at two a.m." </transcript>

      <transcript>Gaius Julius Caesar (July 12 or July 13, 100 BC – March 15, 44 BC), often simply called Julius Caesar, was a Roman military and political leader and one of the most influential men in world history. He played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. His conquest of Gaul extended the Roman world all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, and he was also responsible for the first Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC. Leading his legions across the Rubicon, Caesar sparked civil war in 49 BC that left him the undisputed master of the Roman world. After assuming control of the government, he began extensive reforms of Roman society and government. He was proclaimed dictator for life, and he heavily centralized the bureaucracy of the Republic. This forced the hand of a friend of Caesar, Marcus Junius Brutus, who then conspired with others to murder the dictator and restore the Republic. This dramatic assassination occurred on the Ides of March (March 15th) in 44 BC and led to another Roman civil war. In 42 BC, two years after his assassination, the Roman Senate officially sanctified him as one of the Roman deities. Caesar's military campaigns are known in detail from his own written Commentaries, and many details of his life are recorded by later historians, such as Appian, Suetonius, Plutarch, Cassius Dio and Strabo. Other information can be gleaned from other contemporary sources, such as the letters and speeches of Caesar's political rival Cicero, the poetry of Catullus and the writings of the historian Sallust.</transcript>

      <transcript>Nuclear power held great promise when it came online in the 1960s and 70s. Utilities promised nuclear plants would produce electricity that was clean and cheap, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. But technical problems, high costs, and a change of public opinion turned the tides against nuclear power and during the last two decades, the nuclear industry was a boondoggle. But today, nuclear power may be experiencing a comeback. High oil and gas prices and the threat of global warming have forced many to give nuclear energy a second chance. Living on Earth travels to South Africa to take a look at pebble bed reactors--small-scale, affordable, high temperature plants. Scientists there say this technology will bring nuclear energy that’s safe to the developing world and other nations. The pebble bed technology will bring a a new option to the energy market in the near future which offers flexible, smart grid solutions for electricity, customer-centric process heat and steam solutions for petrochemical industries, oil sands extraction and desalination. It will also pave the way to high temperature hydrogen production.” </transcript>

      <transcript>The mudskipper is a funny looking fish with bulging eyes, and foot-like fins that it uses to hop and crawl around on the slippery flats of the mangrove swamps. It’s at home both on land and in water, and if you’ve ever seen one, you can easily imagine the day in prehistory when it first developed this adaptation and crawled out of the sea. Now Australian researchers say that the evolution of amphibious fish – fish that spend time in and out of water – is more common than we thought. The challenges of breathing air and moving about on land might seem daunting for fish, but biologists from the University of New South Wales report that 130 species and 33 fish families have managed to do it. And species from four families of fish, including gobies, blennies, and eels can spend hours or even days out of water. Amphibious fish exist in all climate regions, and in both fresh and sea water, though they are far more common in saltwater habitats, particularly in the intertidal zone. Intertidal areas vary widely in conditions such as water temperature and the amount of dissolved oxygen, and daily tide cycles expose marine organisms there, including fish, to both sea and land conditions. The researchers say that water temperatures in the intertidal zone often increase as the tide recedes, particularly in pools at low tide. Since increased temperatures reduce the amount of oxygen dissolved in water, they believe that could serve as a stimulus for fish to leave the water – and head for more hospitable habitat on the land. That’s this week’s note on emerging science. </transcript>

      <transcript>Social anxiety is an experience of fear, apprehension or worry regarding social situations and being evaluated by others. People vary in how often they experience anxiety in this way or in which kinds of situations. Anxiety about public speaking, performance, or interviews is common. Social anxiety disorder or SAD, also referred to clinically as social phobia, is a psychiatric anxiety disorder involving overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People experiencing social anxiety often have a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions. Their fear may be so severe that it significantly impairs their work, school, social life, and other activities. While many people experiencing social anxiety recognize that their fear of being around people may be excessive or unreasonable, they encounter considerable difficulty overcoming it. This differs from shyness, in that the person is functionally debilitated and avoids such anxiety provoking situations by all means. At the same time, a person with social anxiety may only feel the fear of the disorder during certain situations. For example, an actor or singer may feel fine on stage, but afraid of social situations in everyday life. </transcript>

      <transcript>The worldwide banking company Goldman Sachs has taken a break from guessing what will happen to the world's economy. Economists from the company have put their heads together and made predictions about how many medals different countries will win at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Their predictions contain no real surprises. Most people could predict that the USA and China will win the most medals. Perhaps a slight surprise is that Goldman Sachs is predicting Great Britain will finish third, as they did in the 2012 London Olympics. The economists predicted 23 gold medals for Team GB and 59 medals in total. They also predict that the world's second most populous country, India, will win just one gold medal. There is good news for host nation Brazil. The country that hosts the Olympics usually gets 50 per cent more golds than usual, and 20 per cent more medals in total. Goldman Sachs predicts that Brazil will get a record 22 medals, including five golds. This would be Brazil's best ever performance in an Olympic games. The economists also predicted the Olympics would benefit Brazil's economy. They said: "As the country welcomes thousands of athletes and visitors and cheers the local favorites, it silently hopes that the soaring Olympic spirit will also help lift the spirits of the Brazilian economy." The 2016 Rio Olympics, Brazil-style, is sure to be one of the best ever. </transcript>

      <description>The right for people to watch their government in action has been an important part of American democracy ever since.

      <description>Although a written document, the Declaration of Independence was intended to be read aloud throughout the colonies as a way of inciting frustrated citizens to rebel against their king. For this reason, it makes sense that it starts slowly, introducing the intellectual argument calmly, before steadily rising to a fever pitch of rage and indignation.</description>

Before burial, however, their bodies were preserved. 1 To do this, the ancient Egyptians would mummify their kings. Mummification was a very careful process. In fact, it took 70 days to complete.</description>

      <transcript>A new report warns that people could be in danger from superbugs if they eat rare and undercooked meat. The report is called the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. Researchers looked into how antibiotics in food are making bugs stronger. The report said the use of antibiotics in agriculture is making bugs stronger and more resistant to our medicines. The researchers said the huge amount of antibiotics in farming could be dangerous to people's health around the world. They suggested that farmers reduce the amount of antibiotics they give to their animals. The leader of the research, Jim O'Neill, said this was important if we wanted to make sure that our life-saving medicines still work effectively. The researchers are calling for strict targets to reduce the number of antibiotics given to farm animals. Mr O'Neill said this was necessary because of the huge amount of antibiotics farmers give their animals. He said: "I find it [unbelievable] that in many countries, most of the consumption of antibiotics is in animals, rather than humans. This creates a big risk for everyone." He added that the public could get ill from superbugs if they ate meat that was rare or undercooked. He said: "My advice to consumers is that they have to make sure they cook meat properly. If you are going to choose to cook it as rare as possible you have to be aware of where it's coming from." </transcript>

      <transcript>Vermont’s State Senate blocked a license extension for the aging – and leaking – Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant. That comes just days after President Obama announced billions of federal dollars to build reactors. The president wants a new generation of nuclear plants, but as the Vermont vote shows, old problems still plague the industry. One of the biggest problems is what to do with nuclear waste. The Obama administration’s budget would eliminate funding for Yucca Mountain. That Nevada site for high-level nuclear waste was supposed to start taking spent fuel from commercial reactors in 1998. But Yucca never opened and very likely never will. Which means, for the indefinite future the radioactive waste from nuclear plants will have to be stored on site. Critics say that generates a whole host of concerns.</transcript>

      <transcript>Australia is home to many unknown species. Researchers now say that it may be home to the world’s fastest lunging predator. The karaops spider is a small and flat spider found only in Australia. The spider is a predator that gets its food by killing and eating other insects. It has eight legs and usually creates a web of sticky threads to catch insects for food.Sarah Crews, 38, is a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. She spent two months in the Australian Outback, collecting 100 karaops spiders. Crews told the Australian Broadcasting Company, or ABC, that collecting the spiders was not easy. They usually hide under loose bark, often on eucalyptus trees. She and her research assistant spent a lot of time turning over rocks to find and catch the speedy spiders. “I’ve worked on these spiders, this family, for about 15 years now and I just don’t really care about other spiders at all anymore,” Crews told ABC. “I just like these guys.” The spiders will be examined with high-definition cameras at the Academy of Sciences.</transcript>

      <transcript>A new report warns that people could be in danger from superbugs if they eat rare and undercooked meat. The report is called the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. Researchers looked into how antibiotics in food are making bugs stronger. The report said the use of antibiotics in agriculture is making bugs stronger and more resistant to our medicines. The researchers said the huge amount of antibiotics in farming could be dangerous to people's health around the world. They suggested that farmers reduce the amount of antibiotics they give to their animals. The leader of the research, Jim O'Neill, said this was important if we wanted to make sure that our life-saving medicines still work effectively. The researchers are calling for strict targets to reduce the number of antibiotics given to farm animals. Mr O'Neill said this was necessary because of the huge amount of antibiotics farmers give their animals. He said: "I find it [unbelievable] that in many countries, most of the consumption of antibiotics is in animals, rather than humans. This creates a big risk for everyone." He added that the public could get ill from superbugs if they ate meat that was rare or undercooked. He said: "My advice to consumers is that they have to make sure they cook meat properly. If you are going to choose to cook it as rare as possible you have to be aware of where it's coming from." </transcript>

      <transcript>Vermont’s State Senate blocked a license extension for the aging – and leaking – Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant. That comes just days after President Obama announced billions of federal dollars to build reactors. The president wants a new generation of nuclear plants, but as the Vermont vote shows, old problems still plague the industry. One of the biggest problems is what to do with nuclear waste. The Obama administration’s budget would eliminate funding for Yucca Mountain. That Nevada site for high-level nuclear waste was supposed to start taking spent fuel from commercial reactors in 1998. But Yucca never opened and very likely never will. Which means, for the indefinite future the radioactive waste from nuclear plants will have to be stored on site. Critics say that generates a whole host of concerns.</transcript>

      <transcript>Australia is home to many unknown species. Researchers now say that it may be home to the world’s fastest lunging predator. The karaops spider is a small and flat spider found only in Australia. The spider is a predator that gets its food by killing and eating other insects. It has eight legs and usually creates a web of sticky threads to catch insects for food.Sarah Crews, 38, is a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. She spent two months in the Australian Outback, collecting 100 karaops spiders. Crews told the Australian Broadcasting Company, or ABC, that collecting the spiders was not easy. They usually hide under loose bark, often on eucalyptus trees. She and her research assistant spent a lot of time turning over rocks to find and catch the speedy spiders. “I’ve worked on these spiders, this family, for about 15 years now and I just don’t really care about other spiders at all anymore,” Crews told ABC. “I just like these guys.” The spiders will be examined with high-definition cameras at the Academy of Sciences.</transcript>
