    <description>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron. She was taught by Mary Somerville, a well-known {blank} and scientific author, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in June 1833. Babbage was an English mathematician, who first had the idea for a programmable computer.
In 1842 and 1843, Ada {blank} the work of an Italian mathematician, Luigi Menabrea, on Babbage's Analytical Engine. Though mechanical, this machine was an important step in the history of computers; it was the design of a mechanical general-purpose computer. Babbage worked on it for many years until his death in 1871. However, because of {blank} , political, and legal issues, the engine was never built. The design of the machine was very modern; it {blank} the first completed general-purpose computers by about 100 years.</description>

    <description>Over the past two decades, an extreme view of global warming has developed. While it contains some facts, this view also contains exaggerations and misstatements, and has sometimes resulted in unreasonable environmental policies.
According to this view, global warming will cause the polar ice to melt, raising global sea levels, flooding entire regions, destroying crops, and displacing millions of people. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding a potential rise in sea levels. Certainly, if the earth warms, sea levels will rise as the water heats up and expands. If the polar ice caps melt, more water will be added to the oceans, raising sea levels even further. There is some evidence that melting has occurred; however, there is also evidence that the Antarctic ice sheets are growing. In fact, it is possible that a warmer sea surface temperature will cause more water to evaporate, and when wind carries the moisture-laden air over the land, it will precipitate out as snow, causing the ice sheets to grow. Certainly, we need to have better knowledge about the hydrological cycle before predicting dire consequences as a result of recent increases in global temperatures.
This view also exaggerates the impact that human activity has on the planet. While human activity may be a factor in global warming, natural events appear to be far more important. Climate variability has always existed and will continue to do so, regardless of human intervention.</description>

      <o0>Sea level is going to increase to great extent.</o0>

      <o3>Global warming is caused by variations in the sun’s radiation and the earth’s orbit?</o3>

    <description>It should be no surprise that anti-Semitism still exists, just as bigotry against blacks, or Muslims, or Sikhs, or Tutsis, or indeed Catholics still goes on. That Jews were the victims of the most systematic genocide ever attempted lend a particularly sinister resonance to anti-Semitism, but as a prejudice it is hardly unique. Mass murder of the Jews, at least in the Western world, is no longer on the agenda, and it is surely not what Gibson had in mind [in his 2007 outburst]. But social prejudice is bad enough. It is at least one sign of progress that anti-Semitism, like racial prejudice against black people, is no longer socially acceptable. We cannot call people 'yids' or 'niggers' without being taken to task for it, and this is a good thing. According to the author of 'Mentality' of a nation is mainly product of its.</description>

    <description>Many people like to eat pizza, but not everyone knows how to make it. Making the perfect pizza can be complicated, but there are lots of ways for you to make a more basic version at home. When you make pizza, you must begin with the crust. The crust can be hard to make. If you want to make the crust yourself, you will have to make dough using flour, water, and yeast. You will have to knead the dough with your hands. If you do not have enough time to do this, you can use a prepared crust that you buy from the store. 
After you have chosen your crust, you must then add the sauce. Making your own sauce from scratch can take a long time. You have to buy tomatoes, peel them, and then cook them with spices. If this sounds like too much work, you can also purchase jarred sauce from the store. Many jarred sauces taste almost as good as the kind you make at home. 
Now that you have your crust and your sauce, you need to add the cheese. Cheese comes from milk, which comes from cows. Do you have a cow in your backyard? Do you know how to milk the cow? Do you know how to turn that milk into cheese? If not, you might want to buy cheese from the grocery store instead of making it yourself. When you have the crust, sauce, and cheese ready, you can add other toppings. Some people like to put meat on their pizza, while other people like to add vegetables. Some people even like to add pineapple! The best part of making a pizza at home is that you can customize it by adding your own favorite ingredients.</description>
    <title>According to the author, which of the following ingredients do you need to have ready before you can add the toppings?</title>
    <options>
      <o0>crust</o0>
      <o1>milk</o1>

    <description>Have you ever wondered what keeps a hot air balloon flying? The same principle that keeps food frozen in the open chest freezers at the grocery store allows hot air balloons to fly. It's a very basic principle: Hot air rises and cold air falls. So while the super-cooled air in the grocery store freezer settles down around the food, the hot air in a hot air balloon pushes up, keeping the balloon floating above the ground. In order to understand more about how this principle works in hot air balloons, it helps to know more about hot air balloons themselves. 
A hot air balloon has three major parts: the basket, the burner, and the envelope. The basket is where passengers ride. The basket is usually made of wicker. This ensures that it will be comfortable and add little extra weight. The burner is positioned above the passenger's heads and produces a huge flame to heat the air inside the envelope. The envelope is the colorful fabric balloon that holds the hot air. When the air inside the envelope is heated, the balloon rises. 
The pilot can control the up-and-down movements of the hot air balloon by regulating the heat in the envelope. To ascend, the pilot heats the air in the envelope. When the pilot is ready to land, the air in the balloon is allowed to cool and the balloon becomes heavier than air. This makes the balloon descend. 
Before the balloon is launched, the pilot knows which way the wind is blowing. This means that she has a general idea about which way the balloon will go. But, sometimes the pilot can actually control the direction that the balloon flies while in flight. This is because the air above the ground is sectioned into layers in which the direction of the wind may be different. So even though the pilot can't steer the balloon, she can fly or higher or lower into a different layer of air. Some days the difference between the direction of the wind between layers is negligible. But other days the difference is so strong that it can actually push the balloon in a completely different direction! </description>

    <options>
      <o0>Air goes up and out the top of a chimney when you light a fire.</o0>

      <o2>its not possible to control the direction of balloon.</o2>

    <description>Most experts agree that global peak oil production, when demand exceeds supply, will occur within the next 15 years and will {blank} change the very fabric of our industrialized world. As fossil fuels power every {blank} of the American economy, how can we avoid an energy crisis and a possible {blank} of our economy? Today, China and India have {blank} to attain our western quality of life; but at the rate and the way we use the world's energy resources, their ambition will be physically impossible. In addition to increasing geopolitical conflicts, the process of extracting and using these crucial resources is {blank} the very own habitat that we depend on to prosper as a species - pushing the earth's climate and ecosystem to a point of no-return. It is clear that in order for us to survive our modern self-destructive societies, we will have to change course drastically and as fast as possible.</description>

    <description>Although the schooling of fish is {blank} form of animal social behavior, how the school is formed and maintained is only beginning to be understood in detail.

In each species a fish has a “preferred” distance and dangle from its nearest neighbor. The ideal separation and bearing, however, are not maintained rigidly. The result is a {blank} arrangement that appears like a random aggregation. The tendency of the fish to remain at the preferred distance and angle, however, serves to maintain the structure.

It then adjusts its own speed to match a weighted average that {blank} the contribution of nearby fish.</description>

    <description>"As a farmer I was determined that we should get on the computer bandwagon", says Krishnappa Jagannath, the 40-year old head of the Gram Panchayat who initiated the whole process three years ago. With tips from a computer, and his brother in the US, Jagannath drew up a plan and convinced others of its merit. Within no time, he was able to raise Rs. 65,000 from the public, enough for the purchase of two assembled Pentium II computers. That was easy enough, but who would operate these machines? Jagannath decided that it had to be the villagers themselves. He got in touch with a software company, which agreed to train the villagers. Although wary initially, the people knew it was worth a try. As they realized it was not so difficult, more and more villagers joined in. Those like T. S. Shobha who showed a greater aptitude were sent for extensive training.</description>

    <description>Can a person’s greatness be recognized only in retrospect, by those who live after him? In my view this is unfairly generalized. In some areas, especially the arts, greatness is often recognizable in its nascent stages. However, in other areas, particularly the physical sciences, greatness must be tested over time before it can be confirmed. In still other areas, such as business, the incubation period for greatness varies from case to case. We do not require a rear-view mirror to recognize artistic greatness whether in music, visual arts, or literature. The reason for this is simple: art can be judged at face value. There’s nothing to be later proved or disproved, affirmed or discredited, or even improved upon or refined by further knowledge or newer technology. History is replete with examples of artistic greatness immediately recognized, then later confirmed.

    <title>What is the author’s perspective on recognizing a person’s greatness or caliber?</title>

    <description>In Asia and much of the third World, trees are still destroyed in the old-fashioned way: they are cut down for fuel and cropland. In Europe, there is a new and potentially more deadly culprit. The German call it 'Waldsterben', the dying forest syndrome. But the disease is far more than a German phenomenon. Since it was first observed by German scientists in the autumn of 1980, the mysterious malady has raced across Europe, blighting woods in countries as far apart as Sweden and Italy. Explanations for the epidemic range from a cyclic change in the environment to a baffling form of tree cancer. But the most convincing evidence points to air pollution. Indeed, saving the rapidly deteriorating forests of Europe will probably require a two-pronged strategy: an offensive campaign that includes the breeding of pollution-immune trees and a defensive scheme that calls for reductions in toxic emissions. But both will require more money than is currently being spent on such measures, as well as total commitment to protecting the environment.</description>
    <title>What are the points of target that the strategy to fight the problem of dying forests includes in itself?</title>
    <options>
		<o0>Finding methods to sustain life for trees and all types of vegetation.</o0>
      <o1>An aggressive movement directed towards breeding of trees that are resistant to pollution.</o1>
      <o2>Conservative efforts for demanding reduction in emission of toxic substances which lead to air pollution.</o2>
      <o3>The attempts to save the trees from being cut and popularizing other alternatives for their use.</o3>
	  <o4>Making available more and more scientific methods that can help reduce the air pollution.</o4>

    <description>Though the U.S. prides itself on being a leader in the world community, a recent report shows that it lags far behind other industrialized countries in meeting the needs of its youngest and most vulnerable citizens. The U.S. has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher proportion of low birth weight babies, a smaller proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases and a much higher rate of adolescent pregnancies. These findings, described as a "quiet crisis" requiring immediate and far-reaching action, appeared in a report prepared by a task force of educators, doctors, politicians and business people. According to the report, a fourth of the nation's 12 million infants and toddlers live in poverty. As many as half confront risk factors that could harm their ability to develop intellectually, physically and socially. Child immunizations are too low, more children are born into poverty and more are in substandard care while their parents work and more are being raised by single parents. When taken together, these and other risk factors can lead to educational and health problems that are much harder and more costly to reverse.</description>
    <title>What were the requirements posed by the "quiet crisis" report?</title>
    <options>
	<o0>Distribution of the report among the common masses.</o0>
      <o1>To focus on the costs that the revealed factors may incur on the government.</o1>
      <o2>To pay heed to the various statistical figures and reports.</o2>
      <o3>No immediate action on the findings laid down.</o3>

    <description>Louis Armstrong was the most{blank}jazz trumpeter of the 20th century. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong began playing in New Orleans clubs and saloons in his early teens. By the 1920s Armstrong was {blank} the country and leading his own band, the Hot Five, later the Hot Seven. He continued to tour and record throughout his life and was particularly famous for his {blank}, loose-limbed improvisations; some call him the first great jazz improviser. His gravelly voice and sunny {blank} were a hit with the non-jazz public, and later in his career he became a sort of cheerful ambassador of jazz, even appearing as himself in movies like High Society and Hello, Dolly!. The theme song from the latter film became his most {blank} known recording.</description>

The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1954 set aside $175 million for the construction of an interstate highway system. However, even more money was needed for the system that Eisenhower -{blank}, and he continued to press for funds. Two years later, the expanded Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized a budget of $25 billion, of which the federal share was to be 90%.

    <description>Scientists have found that small calcium deposits in foetal membranes lead to a mother's water breaking early - solving the mystery behind why some babies are born {blank} .
The study suggests that dietary or other interventions may prevent those preterm births.
Researchers from US Nationwide Children's Hospital found that in preterm, premature rupture of the foetal membranes - that is, water breaking significantly early- the amniotic sac contains {blank} deposits and early markers of bone formation. The membranes, then, are less elastic and more {blank} to breaking.
"We do see calcium deposits in full term births as well, which is probably part of the normal -{blank} of the membranes at the appropriate time," said Irina Buhimschi from Nationwide Children's Hospital.</description>

Rakhigarhi villagers have shown {blank} and given five acres to the state government for just Rs 1 per acre to set up a museum in the village. That was about two years ago. The state government, too, agreed and {blank} a budget of Rs 24 crore in February this year.

        <description>In math education, the definition of “cooperative learning” is greater than the sum of these two words. Mark Reinholz describes peer-assisted reflection (PAR) in an introductory calculus class, {blank} students work together to attempt to solve a problem, {blank} on their work, conference with a peer, and revise and submit a final solution. PAR emphasizes problem-solving processes, including explanation and justification, similar to an inquiry-based science class. The PAR model {blank} peer interaction, with students analysing their peers' work in order to develop analytic skills that they can then apply to their own learning. {blank} success through PAR was significant and comparable to similar active learning interventions in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Most importantly, PAR resulted in students being {blank} likely to drop introductory calculus.

        <description>Tourists who visit national parks and other protected areas in the United States hope to gain a respite from the sights and sounds of their {blank} lives. But evading human sound scapes isn’t easy. Many protected areas are surprisingly noisy, a new study finds, and that can interfere with more than just the peace and quiet visitors seek.
Noise generated by humans-including that from development activities, traffic and the {blank} of natural resources—threaten the survival of plant and animal species across the country, researchers report. “I was frankly shocked to learn how noisy humans have {blank} some of the most remote places on the continent,” says Charlie Zender,an atmospheric physicist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the research.
To determine how much noise came from human activity, the researchers made a background noise model that eliminated all potential sounds created by people, such as aeroplane or car noises. The researchers then compared their estimates of wild soundscape noise levels to the NPS maps, allowing them to determine the extent {blank} which human-made sounds added to noise levels in the protected areas.
The researchers found that 63% of the protected areas were twice as loud as they should be. “So if you used to be able to hear a bird song at 100 feet [30 metres], now you could hear it at 50  feet,” Buxton says. Some areas were even louder: 21% were more than 10 times louder than background levels. In those regions, “you can only hear that bird at about {blank} feet”, she says.

        <description>Mintel consumer intelligence {blank} the 2002 market for vegetarian foods, those that directly replace meat or other animal products, to be $1.5 billion. Note that this excludes traditional vegetarian foods such as produce, pasta, and rice.

Beliefs about soy's  {blank} in reducing the symptoms of menopause also attracted new consumers.

Forty-five percent of respondents had tried tofu, 41% had sampled veggie burgers, and 25% had experience with soymilk. Mintel estimates 2001 sales of frozen and refrigerated meat  {blank} in food stores at nearly $300 million, with soymilk sales nearing $250 million.

        <description>When he was awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of Newcastle, even John Robertson himself must surely have looked back in wonder at his astonishing rise to success.
The year was 1910, and those assembled were to hear not only of his generosity to the University, which enabled it to contribute to the pioneering research into tropical diseases being carried out at that time, but also of his humanitarian work in southern Africa, where he was ahead of his time in improving the working conditions of local mine workers.
To those who knew John in his youth, it will have come as no surprise to hear of his success. He was now enjoying the rewards of the fierce determination, desire to succeed and extraordinary ability to acquire knowledge, which they had noticed in the young man.

        <description>The Turks and Caicos Islands are a multi-island archipelago at the southern tip of the Bahamas chain, approximately 550 miles south-east of Florida. The islands are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom although they exercise a high degree of local political autonomy. The economy of the islands rests mainly on tourism, with some contribution from offshore banking and fishing.
Primary schooling is divided into eight grades, with most pupils entering at the age of four years and leaving at twelve. After two kindergarten years, Grades 1-6 are covered by a graded curriculum in maths, language and science that increases in difficulty as pupils get older. There is little repetition and pupils are expected to progress through primary school in their age cohorts. At the end of primary schooling, pupils sit an examination that serves to stream them in the secondary setting. Primary and secondary school enrolment is virtually universal.
There are a total of ten government primary schools on the islands. Of these, seven are large enough to organize pupils into single grade classrooms. Pupils in these schools are generally grouped by age into mixed-ability classes. The remaining three schools, because of their small pupil numbers, operate with multigrade groupings. They serve communities with small populations whose children cannot travel to a neighbouring larger primary school. Pupils in these classes span up to three grade and age groups.
As far as classroom organization is concerned, the multigrade and monograde classrooms are similar in terms of the number of pupils and the general seating arrangements, with pupils in rows facing the blackboard. There is no evidence that the multigrade teachers operate in a particularly resource-poor environment in the Turks and Caicos Islands. This is in contract to studies conducted in other developing country contexts.

        <description>Nefertiti (ca. 1370 - ca. 1330 BC) was an Egyptian queen and the Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of Akhenaten, an Egyptian Pharaoh. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshiped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. Akhenaten and Nefertiti were responsible for the creation of a whole new religion which changed the ways of religion within Egypt. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egypt. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband’s death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this is a matter of ongoing debate.</description>

        <description>Joseph Pulitzer was born in 1847 in Makó, Hungary. He emigrated to the United States when he was seventeen years old, and was naturalised on his twentieth birthday. He spent his career in journalism working in the mid-west and New York. From 1871 he was also the owner or part-owner of many newspapers. His most famous newspaper was the New York World (which many believe was the model for the Daily Planet of the Superman stories). The World campaigned against corruption, and exposed many scandals. It was also strong supporter of the rights of the working man.

In later life, Joseph Pulitzer collapsed from overwork, and lost his sight. He became dedicated to improving the quality of journalism in America, and donated $1 million to Columbia University to found a school of journalism. However, his most significant contribution was the establishment of the Pulitzer prizes in his will.

These prizes for excellence in journalism have been given every year since 1917 by Columbia University. Since 1942 there have been extra categories for press photography, and later still for criticism, feature writing and commentary. The prize was originally for $500, but today the winners of the prize receive a gold medal. However, the real value of the prize is that it confirms that the journalist who has received the award is the best American journalist of the year- a fact that is worth much more than $500 to the journalist and to the newspaper that employs him or her.

        <description>It has been a year since I started writing my Graduate Journal column for Nature jobs, the past 12 months {blank} with fundamental changes and fundamental constants, both of which I’m glad to have experienced.
When I enrolled in my master’s course at Oxford last year, I had come straight from medical school with the decision to leave clinical science for good. Thinking back, I realize that I didn’t put very much weight on this decision at the time. But today, I more clearly understand the consequences of leaving my {blank} profession. When I meet old friends who are now physicians and surgeons, I sense how our views on medical problems have diverged. They scrutinize the effects of disease and try to eliminate or {blank} them; I try to understand how they come about in the first place. I feel happier working on this side of the problem, although I do occasionally miss clinical work and seeing patients.
However, when I think about the rate at which my medical skills and knowledge have dissipated, the years spent reading weighty medical textbooks, the hours spent at the bedside, I sometimes wonder if these years were partly a waste of time now that I am pursuing a research career.  Nonetheless, I know the {blank} of my medical education. It is easy to forget the importance of the biosciences when working with model organisms in basic research that seem to have nothing to do with a sick child or a suffering elderly person. Yet, I still have vivid memories of the cruel kaleidoscope of severe diseases and of how they can strike a human being. I hope to {blank} these memories as a guide in my current occupation.

        <description>When it comes to job-hunting, first impressions are {blank}. Remember, you are marketing a product - yourself - to a {blank} employer. The first thing the employer sees when greeting you is your attire; thus, you must make every effort to have the proper dress for the type of job you are seeking.
Will dressing properly get you the job? Of course not, but it will give you a {blank} edge and a positive first impression.
How should you dress? Dressing {blank} is always the safest route, but you should also try and do a little investigating of your prospective employer so that what you wear to the interview makes you look as though you fit in with the organization. If you overdress (which is rare but can happen) or under dress (the more likely scenario), the potential employer may feel that you don’t {blank} enough about the job.

        <description>All approaches aim to increase blood flow to areas of tension and to release painful knots of muscle known as “trigger points”.  “Trigger points are tense areas of muscle that are almost {blank} contracting,” says Kippen. “The contraction causes pain, which in turn causes contraction, so you have a {blank} circle. This is what deep tissue massage aims to break.”
The way to do this, as I found out under Ogedengbe’s elbow, is to apply pressure to the point,stopping the blood flow, and then to release, which causes the brain to flood the {blank} area with blood, encouraging the muscle to relax. At the same time, says Kippen, you can fool the tensed muscle into {blank} by applying pressure to a complementary one nearby. “If you cause any muscle to contract, its opposite will expand. So you try to trick the body into relaxing the muscle that is in spasm.”

        <description>Financing of Australian higher education {blank} dramatic change since the early 1970s.
Although the Australian Government provided regular funding for universities from the late 1950s, in 1974 it assumed full responsibility for funding higher education - abolishing tuition fees with the intention of making university accessible to all Australians who had the ability and who wished to participate in higher education.
Since the late 1980s there has been a move towards greater private contributions, {blank} student fees. In 1989, the Australian Government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) which included a loans scheme to help students finance their contributions. This {blank} universities to remain accessible to students by delaying their payments until they could afford to pay off their loans In 2002, the Australian Government introduced a scheme similar to HECS for postgraduate students - the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS).
Funding for higher education comes from various sources. This article examines the three main sources - Australian Government funding, student fees and charges, and HECS. {blank} the proportion of total revenue raised through HECS is relatively small, HECS payments are a {blank} component of students’ university costs, with many students carrying a HECS debt for several years after leaving university.

        <description>To understand how iodine deficiency leads to goiter, it is necessary to look at the underlying physiology of the thyroid gland. The human thyroid gland is the only place in the body where iodine is stored, and it requires a daily supply of about 150 micrograms of iodine entering the body. When food or water is digested, the iodine it contains is either taken up by the thyroid or eliminated from the body through the kidneys into the urine. When supplies are low, the kidneys still eliminate iodine from the body so the capacity of the thyroid to preserve an adequate supply of raw material is threatened.

The thyroid gland consists of thousands of balls of cells, called thyroid vesicles, which enclose a space filled with a jellylike protein called thyroglobulin. These cells have an extraordinary ability to trap iodine from the bloodstream, and the efficiency of this trap can be increased if the amount of iodine in the blood circulation decreases. Once the iodine is trapped by the thyroid vesicles it passes into the thyroglobulin, where the actual manufacture of two kinds of thyroid hormones takes place. The hormones are stored here until they travel back through the thyroid vesicles to enter the bloodstream. The thyroid hormones are then taken to every part of the body where they influence the rate at which the chemical processes of every cell proceed. They have a {G:722}pervasive{/G} effect on the control of oxygen consumption and heat production of the whole body, and they are essential to the healthy growth of body and mind.

The thyroid tries to keep constant the amount of circulating thyroid hormone entering the cells of the body. When iodine supplies are low, the pituitary gland, a small pea-sized gland at the base of the brain, secretes a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that in turn regulates the power of the thyroid to trap iodine and increase the output of the thyroid. If the thyroid is continually stimulated by TSH, the cells get larger and eventually the whole gland enlarges with an increase in the number of its cells. The thyroid may have many temporary crises where iodine supplies are not adequate and where swelling is induced under the influence of TSH. A series of such incidents over a long period of time will eventually cause a large thyroid swelling since the gland does not always resume its previous size and shape.

        <description>Exposure to high levels of noise can cause permanent hearing loss. Neither surgery nor a hearing aid can help correct this type of hearing loss. Short-term exposure to loud noise can also cause a temporary change in hearing (your ears may feel stuffed up) or a ringing in your ears (tinnitus). These short-term problems may go away within a few minutes or hours after leaving the noise. However, repeated exposures to loud noise can lead to permanent tinnitus and/or hearing loss.
Loud noise can create physical and psychological stress, reduce productivity, interfere with communication and concentration, and contribute to workplace accidents and injuries by making it difficult to hear warning signals. The effects of noise-induced hearing loss can be profound, limiting your ability to hear high-frequency sounds, understand speech, and seriously impairing your ability to communicate.
When sound waves enter the outer ear, the vibrations impact the ear drum and are transmitted to the middle and inner ear. In the middle ear, three small bones called the malleus (or hammer), the incus (or anvil), and the stapes (or stirrup) amplify and transmit the vibrations generated by the sound to the inner ear. The inner ear contains a snail-like structure called Cochlea which is filled with fluid and lined with cells with very fine hairs. These microscopic hairs move with the vibrations and convert the sound waves into nerve impulses-the result is the sounds we hear. Exposure to loud noise can destroy these hair cells and cause hearing loss!

        <description>In the late 1980s and early 1990s some efforts were made to reduce farm subsidies. The most dramatic example was that of New Zealand, which scrapped most farm support in 1984. A study of the environmental effects, conducted in 1993, found that the end of fertiliser subsidies had been followed by a fall in fertiliser use (a fall compounded by the decline in world commodity prices, which cut farm incomes). The removal of subsidies also stopped land-clearing and over-stocking, which in the past had been the principal causes of erosion. Farms could cultivate varied crops. The one kind of subsidy whose removal appeared to have been bad for the environment was the subsidy to manage soil erosion.</description>

In a report released on January 23, a team of British researchers says the deadly upwelling began when an exploratory gas well punched through a layer of rock 9,300 feet (2,800 meters) below the surface, allowing hot, high-pressure water to {blank}. The water carried mud to the surface; there it has spread across a region 2.5 miles (4 kilometres) in {blank} in the eight months since the eruption began.
The mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occur in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day. Although the eruption isn’t as violent as a {blank} volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured. The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of SGA today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11,00 people {blank} displaced.

        <description>The ocean floor is home to many unique communities of plants and animals. Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, a 2,000km long coral {blank} off the north eastern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth. The sun’s energy, however, penetrates at most only about 300m below the surface of the water. The relatively shallow penetration of solar energy and the sinking of cold, sub-polar water combine to make most of the deep ocean floor a {blank} environment with few life forms.
In 1977, scientists discovered hot springs at a depth of 2.5km, on the Galapagos Rift (spreading ridge) off the coast of Ecuador. This exciting discovery was not really a {blank}. Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs should be found at the active spreading centres along the mid-oceanic ridges, where magma, at temperatures over 1,000°C, presumably was being erupted to form new oceanic crust. More exciting, because it was totally {blank}, was the discovery of abundant and unusual sea life - giant tube worms, huge clams, and mussels - that {blank} around the hot springs.

        <description>The use of work animals began long before humankind started to practice agriculture. The use of animal power is now considered by many people to be archaic and inefficient. Yet, despite the more than 50 years spent promoting tractorization in developing countries, the development gap between industrialized-countries and those with weak, highly dependent economies has increased. Moreover, the use of current production models, which are more critically dependent on fossil fuel, cannot be considered universally feasible. Alternative energy sources such as the effective use of work animals must urgently be established. Animals not only provide the means by which millions of families make a living, but they also contribute to ecologically and socially acceptable production systems. Moreover, the efficiency of their energy inputs into crop production is higher than that of machines. The rational use of work animals has the potential to contribute, specifically, to the living conditions and security of small-scale subsistence farmers.</description>

        <description>Data from the Pioneer spacecraft of NASA apparently prove the theory that the high surface temperature of Venus is due to an atmospheric greenhouse effect caused mainly by a blanket of carbon dioxide. Such a greenhouse effect is created when energy in the form of sunlight easily passes through a planet's atmosphere, warms its surface, and is converted to heat radiation that is then held in by the atmosphere from top to bottom. Venus has a relatively thin atmosphere like the Earth's, but Venus' atmosphere consists of more than ninety percent carbon dioxide, compared to less than four percent in that of the Earth. Because of its higher percentage of carbon dioxide, Venus' atmosphere traps much more heat radiation than does the Earth's. Thus, the Venus studies are believed to be important to the understanding of possible adverse effects on the Earth's agriculture that could result from the long-term use of fossil fuels, which add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</description>

        <description>When a placebo (saline solution) was given for the first time, it induced neither clinical benefit nor associated neuronal changes in the thalamus, a brain region known to be involved in PD. However, if repeated administrations of apomorphine were performed before placebo administration, a placebo was capable of increasing thalamus neuronal activity along with clinical improvement (reduction of muscle rigidity). Interestingly, the higher the previous administrations of apomorphine was, the larger the neuronal changes and the clinical improvement. When apomorphine was administered for 4 days in a row, the subsequent administration of a placebo induced a response that was as large as the one induced by apomorphine. These changes lasted for 24 hours. The researchers administered apomorphine, either 1, 2, 3 or 4 days before the surgical implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation, which is an effective treatment for PD. During surgery, they replaced apomorphine with a placebo and recorded from single neurons in the thalamus along with the assessment of muscle rigidity of the arm.
Fabrizio Benedetti, from the Department of Neuroscience at University of Turin Medical School, Italy and first author of the study, explained, 'These findings show that is possible to teach neurons in the thalamus to respond to placebos, so that a placebo non-responder can be turned into a placebo responder. These findings may have profound implications and applications, because we can reduce drug intake by exploiting these learning mechanisms. Since this study shows that there is a memory for drug action, the alternate administration drug-placebo-drug- placebo etc. means people would need to take less medication but yet obtain the same clinical benefit.
'If a placebo is given after four previous administrations of apomorphine, the placebo response can be as large as the drug response, and this effect lasts up to 24 hours. Therefore, a future challenge will be to see whether this effect can be extended beyond 24 hours.'

        <description>One of the factors that keeps electric vehicles from wide adoption is range anxiety. Though battery technologies have come a long way in the last decade, with 100 miles on a charge being common and Teslas easily topping 200 miles, people still want to know they can take off on a family vacation or a weekend away. A French company has a cute solution to this problem: EP Tender, a generator housed in a little two-wheeled trailer pulled by your EV(electronic vehicle). It’s just over 4 feet long and over 400 pounds, which seems like a lot for an EV to pull. That might seem like a heavy piece of equipment to tow behind an EV, but the idea isn’t to tow a generator behind your car all day every day. It’s meant to be a range extender that owners can rent for longer trips. It’s even got a rack on top for your extra gear or vacation luggage. The company is also planning on making both gasoline-fueled and fuel-cell versions of the generator so drivers can choose between easy convenience and eco-friendliness. You’re probably wondering how you’d park this thing, but EP Tender has already thought of that and engineered their way out of the problem. The EV pulls into a parking space with the EP Tender and inches to spare. Then, to leave the space, the EP Tender deploys its secondary set of smaller wheels and lifts the larger rear wheels off the ground. They can then track with the car as it backs up. When the driver is ready to drive forward, the EP Tender puts its regular wheels down and lifts that secondary set up, and it’s ready to go. This wheel design is actually the subject of the EP Tender’s patent. </description>
        <title>Which of the following statements are true about the EP Tender? </title>
        <options>
          <o0>It is designed so that users can tow it behind their car every day.</o0>

        <description>Well, the old tree of life idea {blank} talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, {blank}. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say 'that's all wrong - there's really only three major groups in life: there's the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this {blank} life; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of {blank} us again after being the centre of the universe.</description>

        <description>The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge {blank} New York Harbor. It has done so for more than 50 years. But there is a {blank}. The name of the bridge is spelled wrong.
The bridge is named for Giovanni da Verrazzano. (Unlike the bridge, his name has two Zs.) He was an Italian explorer. In 1524, he was the first European to {blank} New York Harbor. The state office that controls the bridge has said the same thing about the name for years: We know it's wrong, but we're not changing it.
Changing the spelling would be {blank}. Signs, maps, and websites would all have to be changed. New York's Triborough Bridge was changed to Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in 2008. The change cost $4 million.

        <description>The {blank} paradigm in novel writing during the second half of the nineteenth century was no longer the Romantic idealism of the earlier part of the century. What took hold among the great novelists in Europe and America was a new {blank} to character and subject matter, a school of thought which later came to be known as Realism. On one level, Realism is {blank} what it sounds like. It is attention to detail, and an effort to {blank} the true nature of reality in a way that novelists had never attempted. There is the belief that the novel’s function is simply to report what happens, without comment or {blank}. Seemingly inconsequential elements gain the attention of the novel functioning in the realist mode.</description>

While touring Europe, Wordsworth came into contact with the French Revolution.

      <description>There is disagreement on how tigers came to be located where they are, though one popular theory is that all of these big cats {blank} in the cold areas of Siberia or Northern Asia. It is possible there was a southern movement of ice which forced the animals to make the move into China and Manchuria.
At this point there {blank} a three-way split, with groups travelling to India, the Caspian Sea and South-East Asia. The third group would then have split once more, this time into two, with these animals continuing onto Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia, or Java, Sumatra and Bali.
Early tiger fossils {blank} in Alaska which help add some credence to this theory.
But this is only one of several ideas and many experts disagree with it, saying an animal originating from snowy Siberia would {blank} be in need of stripes for camouflage. The stripes strongly indicate tigers originated from areas of tall grasslands and forests where frequent fires probably occurred. At this time in history Siberia did not have those conditions.

      <description>All viruses are made up of two kinds of substance. First, all viruses contain proteins. Proteins are chemical substances that occur in all living creatures. A particle, or molecule, of a protein consists of a long chain of substances called amino acids. There are about 20 different kinds of amino acid in proteins. These can be arranged in any order on the protein chain. Different kinds of plant or animal contain proteins with different arrangements of amino acids. The protein generally forms the outer coat of a virus. This outer layer of protein encloses the second kind of substance found in all viruses - nucleic acid.</description>

      <description> Same species, most of them insects, benefit increasingly from man 's activities. Modern, large-scale agriculture offers them a paradise. Crops are grown year after year in the same or nearby fields, helping insects populations to build up. Many of the worst pests are insect invaders from foreign countries that have left their natural enemies behind and so are as free as man himself from the check of nature's balance. Agricultural scientists try hard to find ways to check insect pests by tricks of cultivation.

      <description>The National Health Service of the country was set up in 1948 shortly after the end of the Second World War. Its aim is to provide free medical treatment for all patients who wish to take advantage of the service. However, it is still possible to obtain private medical treatment and in this case the doctor charges a fee. To say that the National Health Service is free is not entirely true. Every employed or self-employed person over sixteen years of age must put a stamp on an insurance card every week. This card is issued by a government department called the Department of Health and Social Security. The stamp costs money and the amount is constantly changing. Part of the cost of this stamp, in fact the greater part, is borne by the employer and it finances the National Health Service together with many other social security benefits.</description>

You will be a man of glory, a great leader of your people." Sukarno never forgot those words. Liberating his land from 350 years of colonial rule, he moulded many disparate peoples into a nation that became the fifth most populous in the world, one of the richest of all in natural resources. He gave his people a language of their own, raised their literacy rate from six to above 55 percent, gave them an intense from pride in being Indonesians. He had monumental talents: an oratorical gift that could sway and charm, an abundance of that indefinable mystique called "charisma." Responding, his people gave him loyalty beyond love, reverence approaching god-worship.</description>

      <description>It is a strange that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is admired or despised. A successful businessman does nothing to increase his popularity by being careful with his money. He is expected to display his success, to have smart car, an expensive life, and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that if he had not been careful with his money in the first place, he would never have achieved his present wealth. Among the two income groups, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he hadn’t paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles- so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes; she is able to face the milkman with equanimity and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford. As for myself, I fall into neither of these categories. If I have money to spare, I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up, then I am the meanest man imaginable.</description>

    <description>Rice That Fights Global Warming
More than half the global population relies on rice as a regular part of their diet. But rice paddies have a downside for the planet too: they produce as much as 17 percent of the world's total methane emissions. That is even more than coal mining emissions, which make 10 percent of total! So Christer Jansson, a plant biochemist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, spent the past 10 years developing SUSIBA2, a genetically modified rice plant that emits almost no methane.</description>

    <description>Is violence innate?
 In 1983, archaeologists in southern Germany discovered a mass grave containing 34 skeletons. They included 9 adult males, 7 adult females and 16 children. All of the skeletons showed signs of fatal trauma, including head wounds. None of them showed any signs of defensive wounds, suggesting they were killed whilst running away. 
 The "Talheim Death Pit" dates from the Stone Age, around 7,000 years ago. It offers some of the oldest evidence of organized group violence between two communities: that is, of war. 
 Clearly, humans have been fighting wars for thousands of years, and we may not be the only ones. There is growing evidence that several other species also engage in warfare, including our closest relatives the chimpanzees. That suggests we have inherited our predilection for warfare from our ape-like ancestors. But not everyone agrees that warfare is inbuilt. </description>

    <description>When he was awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of Newcastle, even John Robertson himself must surely have looked back in wonder at his astonishing rise to success.
The year was 1910, and those assembled were to hear not only of his generosity to the University, which enabled it to contribute to the pioneering research into tropical diseases being carried out at that time, but also of his humanitarian work in southern Africa, where he was ahead of his time in improving the working conditions of local mine workers.
To those who knew John in his youth, it will have come as no surprise to hear of his success. He was now enjoying the rewards of the fierce determination, desire to succeed and extraordinary ability to acquire knowledge, which they had noticed in the young man.

    <description>The Turks and Caicos Islands are a multi-island archipelago at the southern tip of the Bahamas chain, approximately 550 miles south-east of Florida. The islands are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom although they exercise a high degree of local political autonomy. The economy of the islands rests mainly on tourism, with some contribution from offshore banking and fishing.
Primary schooling is divided into eight grades, with most pupils entering at the age of four years and leaving at twelve. After two kindergarten years, Grades 1-6 are covered by a graded curriculum in maths, language and science that increases in difficulty as pupils get older. There is little repetition and pupils are expected to progress through primary school in their age cohorts. At the end of primary schooling, pupils sit an examination that serves to stream them in the secondary setting. Primary and secondary school enrolment is virtually universal.
There are a total of ten government primary schools on the islands. Of these, seven are large enough to organize pupils into single grade classrooms. Pupils in these schools are generally grouped by age into mixed-ability classes. The remaining three schools, because of their small pupil numbers, operate with multigrade groupings. They serve communities with small populations whose children cannot travel to a neighboring larger primary school. Pupils in these classes span up to three grade and age groups.
As far as classroom organization is concerned, the multigrade and monograde classrooms are similar in terms of the number of pupils and the general seating arrangements, with pupils in rows facing the blackboard. There is no evidence that the multigrade teachers operate in a particularly resource-poor environment in the Turks and Caicos Islands. This is in contract to studies conducted in other developing country contexts.
</description>
    <title>According to the text, which of the following statements can be concluded about primary classes in the Turks and Caicos Islands?</title>
    <options>
      <o0>Multigrade classes are mostly found in smaller schools.</o0>
      <o1>Most primary pupils are in multigrade classes</o1>
      <o2>Parents can choose to send their child to a multigrade school</o2>
      <o3>Most primary pupils are in mixed-ability classes.</o3>
      <o4>Multigrade classes are for the youngest three grades</o4>

    <description>{blank} computing relies on binary digits or bits - ones and zeros representing on/off, true/false states. Quantum computing, on the other hand, features qubits, which can be both 0 or 1 at the same time - a state known as superposition. It all goes back to Schrodinger's cat, but that's another story...
Subatomic particles such as electrons, photons or ions can be made to behave in this {blank} way. And because of this {blank} , qubits can do a lot more - a quantum computer could theoretically carry out trillions of calculations per second.</description>

    <description>Meteorologists {blank} define four seasons in many climatic areas: spring, summer, autumn (fall) and winter. These are demarcated by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis, with each season lasting three months. The three warmest months are by definition summer, the three coldest months are winter and the {blank} gaps are spring and autumn. Spring, when defined in this manner, can start on different dates in different regions.
In most Northern Hemisphere {blank} locations, spring months are March, April and May, although differences exist from country to country. Most Southern Hemisphere temperate locations have {blank} seasons with spring in September, October and November.
Swedish meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius for seven {blank} days, thus the date varies with latitude and elevation. In Australia and New Zealand, spring conventionally begins on 1 September and ends 30 November. </description>

    <description>At the time of the Titanic’s maiden voyage in 1912, the ship was confidently proclaimed to be unsinkable. Her builders, crew and passengers had no doubt that she was the finest ship ever built. But still she did sink on April 14, 1912, taking 1,517 of her passengers and crew with her. The Titanic had sixteen lifeboats which could carry just over half the number of people on board and only a third of the Titanic’s total capacity. The belief that the Titanic was unsinkable was so strong that passengers and crew alike clung to the belief even as she was actually sinking. Not realizing the magnitude of the impending disaster themselves, the officers allowed several boats to be lowered only half full. The officers were afraid the lifeboats would buckle under the weight of the passengers as they had not been informed that the lifeboats had been fully tested prior to departure. As the Titanic sank, another ship, believed to have been the Californian, was seen less than twenty miles away. The Californian’s wireless operator slept unaware while 1,500 Titanic passengers and crew drowned only a few miles away.</description>
    <title>According to text, which of the following are true statements about the Titanic?</title>
    <options>
      <o0>Nobody had thought of installing enough lifeboats to accommodate all the passengers.</o0>
      <o1>The officers had grave concerns about the lifeboats would not be capable of holding so many passengers.</o1>
      <o2>The news of this tragic event created waves of sadness across the world.</o2>
      <o3>The enormous loss of life on the Titanic was primarily caused by inadequate equipment, training and procedures.</o3>

    <description>The paleolithic diet is based mainly on foods presumed to be available to paleolithic humans who lived 2.6 million years ago. This diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat, and organ meats. The Paleolothic diet excludes foods such as dairy products, grains, sugar, legumes, processed oils, salt, and alcohol or coffee. The diet is based on avoiding not just modern processed foods, but also on eating the foods that humans during Paleolithic times ate. Like other fad diets, the Paleo diet as it is referred to, is promoted as a way of improving health.  There is limited data on the health effects on humans eating this diet.
The digestive abilities of modern humans are different from those of paleolithic humans, undermining the diet’s core premise. Although little is known about the diet of Paleolithic humans, it is very likely that they consumed wild grains and legumes. During the Paleolithic era, the highly variable climate and worldwide spread of human population meant that humans were nutritionally adaptable. In contrast, supporters of the diet assume that human digestion has remained essentially unchanged over time. </description>
    <title>Which of the following are true statements about the paleolithic diet?</title>
    <options>
      <o0>It has little proven health benefits.</o0>
      <o1>It is based on what our human ancestors ate.</o1>
      <o2>It is adapted to the digestion of modern humans.</o2>
      <o3>Our human ancestors probably ate more than what is included in today’s “paleolithic” diet.</o3>

    <description>Why does coffee shoot out of the lid of your cup?
You're running late for work and you've purchased your coffee in a hurry. Just as you arrive at the office, a jet of hot liquid escapes from the tiny hole in the lid, leaving you with hot beverage residue on your clothes before the day has really started.
This is exactly what happened to Rob Kaczmarek after buying a cup of his favorite caffeinated drink. The marketing director at Convergent Science was intrigued by why the coffee shoots out so far and therefore set about modeling this, initially as a joke for those who enjoy a bit of computational fluid dynamics. It's the design of the lid that's the problem, he explains.</description>

Simplest of all is the universe at large, it is far less complicated than the Earth, one of its most trivial members.

    <description>When we accept the evidence of our unaided eyes and describe the Sun as a yellow star, we have summed up the most important single fact about it-at this moment in time. It appears probable, however, that sunlight will be the color we know for only a negligibly small part of the Sun’s history. Stars, like individuals, age and change. As we look out into space, We see around us stars at all stages of evolution. There are faint blood-red dwarfs so cool that their surface temperature is a mere 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, there are searing ghosts blazing at 100, 000 degrees Fahrenheit and almost too hot to be seen, for the great part of their radiation is in the invisible ultraviolet range. Obviously, the “daylight” produced by any star depends on its temperature; today(and for ages to come) our Sun is at about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and this means that most of the Sun’s light is concentrated in the yellow band of the spectrum, falling slowly in intensity toward both the longer and shorter light waves.
That yellow “hump” will shift as the Sun evolves, and the light of day will change accordingly. It is natural to assume that as the Sun grows older, and uses up its hydrogen fuel which it is now doing at the spanking rate of half a billion tons a second- it will become steadily colder and redder. Which of the following statements can be supported by this text?</description>

      <o0>The passage is mainly about the evolutionary cycle of the Sun</o0>
      <o1>Hot stars are referred to as “ghosts because they are nearly invisible.</o1>
      <o2>The important thing about the Sun at the present time is that it appears yellow</o2>
      <o3>As the Sun continues to age, it is likely to become colder and redder in color.</o3>
      <o4>Sun has a short history and it always remains the same.</o4>

    <description>“Uncle” said Luke to the old Sean “You seem to be well fed, though I know no one looks after you. Nor have I seen you leave your residence at any time. Tell me how you manage it?” “Because” Sean replied, “I have a good feed every night at Emperor’s orchard. After dark, I go there myself and pick out enough fruits to last a fortnight.” Luke proposed to accompany his uncle to the orchard. Though reluctant because of Luke’s habit of euphoric exhibition of extreme excitement, Sean agreed to take him along. At the orchard while Sean hurriedly collected the fruits and left, Luke on the other hand at the sight of unlimited supply of fruits was excited and lifted his voice which brought Emperor’s men immediately to his side. They seized him and mistook him as the sole cause of damage to the orchard. Although Luke reiterated that he was a bird of passage, they pounded him mercilessly before setting him free. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?</description>

    <description>Trinity College was {blank} by Sir Thomas Pope in 1555. A devout catholic with no surviving children, Thomas Pope saw the Foundation of an Oxford college as a means of ensuring that he and his family would always be remembered in the prayers and masses of its members.
He came from a family of small landowners in Oxford-shire, trained as a lawyer, and rose rapidly to prominence  under  Henry VIII. As Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations he handled the estates of the monasteries {blank} at the Reformation, and amassed a considerable personal  fortune . Pope was a discreet and trusted privy counselor of Mary Tudor, and it was from Mary and Philip that he {blank} Letters Patent and royal approval for his new foundation. Pope died in 1559.
Although his religious ideals were never fully realized - Elizabeth I had succeeded her sister and England {blank}  to the Protestant faith - nonetheless the memory of his name, like his college, has endured the fluctuating fortunes of over 400 years. His wife, Lady Elizabeth Pope, was a particularly influential {blank} in Trinity’s early years.
Pope’s foundation was for a President, twelve Fellows and twelve scholars, all supported by the income from his {blank} endowment of lands, and for up to twenty undergraduates.
The Fellows, all men, were required to take Holy Orders and remain unmarried. The College Statutes set out rules for a simple monastic life of religious observance and study. The Garden was an informal grove of trees, mainly elms, among-st which the members of the College could  walk and meditate.

    <description>Speed reading, or increasing the rate at which you read text, {blank} to increasing the rate at which you understand what you’re reading. The key to successful speed reading is increasing your understanding of the text as you increase the rate at which you read the words. It takes training and practice, but don’t be intimidated by the idea of a {blank} . Think of it as the next, natural step to your reading development. Once you’ve mastered it, it’s a skill that will stick with you for the rest of your life. 

As a child, when you began to learn to read, chances are you began with the alphabet and the specific sounds each letter {blank} . Then you learned how to combine and {blank} letter sounds to decipher words. It’s called letter-by-letter reading. Then something clicked and you began to recognize words without having to sound out each letter one at a time and you graduated to word-by-word reading. 

With continued practice common words and sentence structure became more familiar and because your brain was tuned and ready, your eye started taking in blocks of words at a time. The difference between {blank} readers and speed readers is in the blocks of words their eyes take in at one time. The larger the blocks, the faster your eye moves {blank} the text. </description>

    <description>The name of Galileo is {blank} linked with the advent, early in the seventeenth century, of a marked change in the balance between speculative philosophy, mathematics, and experimental evidence in the study of natural phenomena. The period {blank} by his scientific publications began with the announcement of the first telescopic astronomical discoveries in 1610 and closed with the first systematic attempt to extend the mathematical treatment of physics from statics to kinematics and the strength of materials in 1638. The same period witnessed Kepler’s mathematical transformation of planetary theory and Harvey’s experimental attack on physiological dogma. Historians {blank} in their assessment of this widespread scientific revolution with respect to its elements of continuity and innovation, both as to method and as to content.

    <description>A country should defend itself largely with the armaments it can produce, not with the pricey imported toys its forces may want. If this tenet were to dictate policy, India could greatly boost its manufacturing capabilities and create tens of thousands of jobs at home through a vibrant military industrial complex. From being the world's largest arms importer, India would emerge as a worthy exporter. Given that India has not fought a full-fledged war in 35 years and is unlikely to face full-scale aggression in the next decade, it is possible to implement in stages, such a principle. In this light, the Agni-3 test freeze is troubling. India's primary focus ought to be on preventing aggression through indigenous deterrent assets, not on seeking to defeat aggression with extravagant weapons from abroad. Yet the PM has acted quite the reverse from accepting nuclear-capability limits under a misbegotten deal with the US to providing assurances on multibillion dollar imports of US arms and reactors. The Agni-3 test freeze epitomizes the mounting costs of the nuclear deal. In fact, from the period since Rajiv Gandhi conducted the first Agni test exactly 17 years ago, the Agni program has been significantly crimped by a succession of weak, vacillating PMs.</description>

    <description>When the abbreviation OBC is spelt out, it refers to Other Backward Classes and not Castes. This is the meaning that the Constitution of India gave to the phrase. There is a world of difference between the two and it is only by means of deft political jugglery that the impression has been conveyed that the Constitution is interested in uplifting a section of the population that can be labeled under the totally spurious term called backward caste. As the Constitution was interested in the lot of backward classes, it did not easily equate them with any cluster of castes, nor did it privilege a solely caste-based criterion to determine them. Backward classes could mean the poor, or village-based artisans, or the unemployed, or those who are in remote regions, or those who are educationally deficient, or those who suffer from food deprivation. In all such cases, the focus is on actual people and not communities. As those answering to such descriptions could come from any caste group, the founding figures of the Constitution, very purposively, used the term OBC strictly in terms of classes and not castes. Contrast this with the way the Scheduled Castes were classified by the Constitution. The job of determining which castes were untouchables proved tricky, so in all such cases, only the caste criterion was the determining factor. Economic or educational concerns had no role to play when it came to deciding on the listing of the Scheduled Castes. So when the Constitution clearly states "classes" and not "castes", as in the term OBC, it is deliberate, and not an oversight.</description>

    <description>While day-to-day tasks need to be redesigned to provide opportunities for deepening the operational skills of employees, it is equally necessary to reshape the broader strategic and administrative processes of a company so as to broaden its people's analytical and conceptual skills, and to enhance their quality of thinking and judgment. Less tangible and concrete, these latter sets of skills and capabilities are perhaps more crucial both for protecting people's employability and for enabling them to take responsibility for the company's competitiveness. At the same time, widening employees' access to these skills requires radical changes in a company's core management processes-a far more daunting task than re-engineering day-to-day operations. In most companies, strategic thinking and qualitative judgment are seen as the preserves of top management, and it is only they who have the opportunity to develop and deploy these capabilities. To move up the relevant information that typically resides at the operating levels, companies create elaborate systems of planning, communication and control. Such a formal, systems driven management process is often viewed as the essence of professional management, with the elaborateness of the systems as the measure of the company's managerial sophistication.</description>

    <description>Since the birth of the skyscraper, builders and engineers have {blank} looked for ways to improve building methods and materials, in order to make structures stronger, taller, and lighter. Skyscrapers are built to last, so they must be made of materials that are strong; durable; resistant to the sun, wind, rain, frost, and snow; and affordable. Concrete is one of the most common materials, beyond the steel supports, because it is enormously {blank} . Its composition can be changed depending on the needs of the building. It can be {blank} to make it stiffer and stronger by setting steel mesh or bars into the concrete. And additives can make it set or harden faster or slower depending on the needs of the design. Another very important material is glass. Because the steel skeleton now supports the main loads of the building, the outer skin only {blank} to keep the weather out and let light in, the more light the better. So glass walls became very popular beginning after World War II, because they are weatherproof while providing ample natural light, and also because they are so much lighter-and cheaper-than  {blank} or concrete.</description>

    <description>It seems there have been many Alexander the Greats - as many as there have been serious students of him as man, hero or God. There are two main reasons for this, multiplicity and plasticity. First, and more poetically, the great leader's achievements - both in his lifetime and posthumously (the Alexander myth or legend) - are simply staggering. Second, the original narrative sources that survive for Alexander are mostly either very non-contemporary or very skewed by partisanship - pro or con, or both. In the past there have been those who saw him as essentially reasonable and gentlemanly, or dynamic and titanic, or Homerically heroic. But the recent trend has been decidedly negative, emphasizing variously his conquering bloodlust, his megalomania, or alleged alcoholism. Here I hope not to err on the side of gratuitous mudslinging, in my search for clues to the mainsprings of Alexander's character. But I do lay stress on his grand passion for hunting game - human as well as animal and the bigger and more dangerous the better. Such macho feats offered him the chance to enhance his standing in the eyes of his subjects, as well as to ensure an impressive reputation into posterity.</description>
    <title>Which of the following contradicts the image of Alexander as painted by the author?</title>
    <options>
      <o0>He was courteous and energetic</o0>
      <o1>He was driven by the zeal for conquest at the price of bloodshed</o1>

    <description>Until he was ten, young Alexander Fleming attended the nearby Loudon Moor School. He was then transferred to Dagvel School, which he attended with his brothers. Alexander learned a good deal about nature during that four-mile downhill hike to school and the four-mile uphill return trip. He was a quick student and at twelve, the age limit prescribed for Dagvel School, he was sent to Kilmarnock Academy. After two years he joined his brothers, John and Robert, at the home of his elder brother Thomas, who was to become a successful oculist in London. However, the economic success of the family was yet to be and Alexander was forced to leave school for economic reasons. When he was sixteen, he obtained a job in a shipping company. Good fortune, however, was on his side and on the side of humanity. In 1901, he received a share in a legacy which made it possible for him to return to school where he decided to study medicine.</description>

The heart pumps the blood and the arteries and veins {blank} it. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart and enters the biggest artery, called the aorta. The aorta {blank} into smaller arteries which then branch into even smaller vessels that travel all over the body. When blood enters the smallest blood vessels, which are called capillaries, and are found in body tissue, it gives {blank} and oxygen to the cells and takes in carbon dioxide, water, and waste. The blood, which no longer contains oxygen and nutrients, then goes back to the heart through veins. Veins carry waste products away from cells and bring blood back to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs to pick up oxygen and {blank} waste carbon dioxide.</description>
