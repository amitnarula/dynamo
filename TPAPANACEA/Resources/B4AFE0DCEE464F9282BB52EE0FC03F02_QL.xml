    <description>There's about 113 million books that have been written since the dusk of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million approximately. And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very convincingly review trends in our history and our culture.
So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanity will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to realize new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.

    <description>So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems," because they're often dominated by {blank} species, and because they're just super weird. They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before. For so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as {blank} . We're talking about re-grown agricultural fields, timber {blank} that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis, second-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast, where after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up. And of course, pretty much all of {blank} , where novel ecosystems are the norm, where exotic species totally dominate. This forest here has Queensland maple, it has {blank} ferns from Southeast Asia. You can make your own novel ecosystem, too. It's really simple. You just stop mowing your lawn.</description>

    <description>In May of 2010, a flash crash on Wall Street {blank} by a feedback loop in Wall Street's "sell" algorithm wiped a trillion dollars of value in 36 minutes. I don't even want to think what "error" means in the context of {blank} autonomous weapons.

    <description>Dane is a serious entrepreneur who started many companies in a pay secrecy condition and even used that condition to pay three equally qualified people dramatically different salaries, depending on how well they could negotiate. And Dane saw the strive that happened as a result of this. So when he started his newest company, Sum All, he committed to salary transparent  from the beginning. And the results have been amazing. And in study after study, when people know how they're being paid and how that pay compares to their peers', they're more likely to work hard to improve their performance, more likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.
That's why Dane's not alone. From technology start-ups like Buffer, to the hundreds of thousands of employees at Whole Foods, where not only is your salary available for everyone to see, but the performance data for the store and for your department is available on the company intranet for all to see.

    <description>So what I did during my job is cultivate plants in the greenhouse, different ones, diverse milkweeds. Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed, with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. And some were not toxic. And then I feed them to monarchs. Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease. But some of the monarchs were sick, and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they decrease the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies, meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants.</description>
