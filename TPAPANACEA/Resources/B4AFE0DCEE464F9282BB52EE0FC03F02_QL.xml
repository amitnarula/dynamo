    <description>There's about 113 million books that have been written since the dusk of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million approximately . And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very convincingly review trends in our history and our culture.
So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanity will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to realize new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.

So for long-term perspective, we explore and exploit for a short-term. Small children explore all day and as we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on. The same goes for companies as they are less innovative as they become more competent.</answer>

    <description>So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems," because they're often dominated by {blank} species, and because they're just super weird. They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before. For so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as {blank} . We're talking about re-grown agricultural fields, timber {blank} that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis, second-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast, where after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up. And of course, pretty much all of {blank} , where novel ecosystems are the norm, where exotic species totally dominate. This forest here has Queensland maple, it has {blank} ferns from Southeast Asia. You can make your own novel ecosystem, too. It's really simple. You just stop mowing your lawn.</description>

    <description>Dane is a serious entrepreneur who started many companies in a pay secrecy condition and even used that condition to pay three equally qualified people dramatically different salaries, depending on how well they could negotiate. And Dane saw the strive that happened as a result of this. So when he started his newest company, Sum All, he committed to salary transparent  from the beginning. And the results have been amazing. And in study after study, when people know how they're being paid and how that pay compares to their peers', they're more likely to work hard to improve their performance, more likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.
That's why Dane's not alone. From technology start-ups like Buffer, to the hundreds of thousands of employees at Whole Foods, where not only is your salary available for everyone to see, but the performance data for the store and for your department is available on the company intranet for all to see.

    <description>So what I did during my job is cultivate plants in the greenhouse, different ones, diverse milkweeds. Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed, with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. And some were not toxic. And then I feed them to monarchs. Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease. But some of the monarchs were sick, and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they decrease the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies, meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants.</description>

    <description>We humans have been making war since before we were even fully human. And since then, we have gone from using stone and sinew to developing the most {blank} and devastating weapon systems imaginable. And to enable our warriors to use these weapons, we employ the most cutting-edge training methods. We are good at making war. And we are good at training our {blank} to fight.
Yet, when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat {blank}, we begin to see that we have not been as good at preparing them to come home. Why is that? Well, our ancestors lived {blank} in conflict, and they fought right where they lived. So until only very recently in our evolutionary history, there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war, because we never really did. But thankfully, today, most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies, and when there is {blank}, we, especially in the United States, now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training, drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe and when they're done, jet them back to peacetime {blank}.

    <description>New research shows that office employees and other people who sit down a lot more exercise for one hour a day. If they do this, they will increase their chances of living longer. Doctors have been telling us for a many time that sitting down all day will shorten our life. Researchers now say that sitting in a chair all day is as dangerous to our health as smoking or being overweight. Research on over one billion adults found that sitting for at least eight hours a day could increase the risk of dying early by up to 80 per cent. However, there is good news for those who sit at a desk all day. An hour's "brisk exercise" each day can cancel out the risk of an early death linked to sitting all day.</description>

    <description>Billions of people around the world take dietary supplements in the trust that they will boost their health. New research casts doubt on the benefits of these pills and tablets. A new report from the American organization Consumer Reports (CR) found high health risks from
supplements that included vitamins, probiotics, and weight loss pills. CR said the main problem with supplements is that they are largely unregulated. While medicinal drugs have to be tested for safety and effectiveness, dietary supplements need far less government approval in many countries. This means that consumers are largely in the darkness regarding the ingredients of the supplements and how the body will react to them.

It's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work and sometimes home life. It's a place where we don't have to worry about how we're being perceived by the outside world. It's a place where we don't feel threatened, or {blank}. It's a place of loyalty and trust. For that reason, it's one of the few places where we can {blank} be ourselves and just  talk. The talk, the shop talk, the conversation, that is the essence of the black barbershop.</description>

    <description>Our scientists then use this to go back to another part of that tissue and do what's called electronic scanning micro-dissection. So the technician takes the instructions. They scribed along a place there. And then the laser actually cuts. You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. You can see on the microscope transcripts here, that's what's happening in real time. There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. We take that tissue, we rectify the RNA out of it using some basic technology, and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a macroarray .</description>

    <description>Now, I think that if you ask people how attractive they think Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to give them a score between one and four I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very easy. So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees that she's very elegant, whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread that makes you more popular on an offline Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people think that you're attractive, you're actually better off having some other people think that you're a huge minger. That's much better than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door.</description>

    <answer>The lecture is on reforming and commercializing the agricultural industries in Africa and in India. Commercialization is about the entire agricultural system but also means confronting the fact that we can no longer place the burden of growth on small-scale farmers. We can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success of small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture. This will maximize probability of success in reaching your intended goal.</answer>
	<transcript>We need to reform and commercialize the agricultural industries in Africa and in India.Now, by commercialization -- commercialization is not about commercial farming alone. Commercialization is about leveraging data to craft better policies, to improve infrastructure, to lower the transportation costs and to completely reform banking and insurance industries. Commercialization is about taking agriculture from too risky an endeavor to one where fortunes can be made. Commercialization is not about just farmers. Commercialization is about the entire agricultural system. But commercialization also means confronting the fact that we can no longer place the burden of growth on small-scale farmers alone, and accepting that commercial farms and the introduction of commercial farms could provide certain economies of scale that even small-scale farmers can leverage. It is not about small-scale farming or commercial agriculture, or big agriculture. We can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success of small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture. This is because, for the first time ever, the most critical tool for success in the industry -- data and knowledge -- is becoming cheaper by the day. And very soon, it won't matter how much money you have or how big you are to make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success in reaching your intended goal.</transcript>

    <answer>Caring for someone should be a choice and should be done without putting one's own well-being in the balance, what needed is a deep, societal, structural change which can only happen through a change in mindset. If carers around the world felt better recognized, it would not only improve their own well-being and sense of fulfillment, but would also improve the lives of those that they're caring for. </answer>
	<transcript>Caring for someone should be a choice and should be done without putting one's own well-being in the balance. But to really put the care back into health care, what's needed is a deep, societal, structural change. And this can only happen through a change in mindset. And this can start today. Today, we can plant the seed for a change for millions of carers around the world.
Here's what I want to suggest: when you go home today or to the office tomorrow morning, embrace a carer. Thank them, offer him or her a bit of help, maybe even volunteer as a carer yourself for a couple hours a week. If carers around the world felt better recognized, it would not only improve their own health and well-being and sense of fulfillment, but it would also improve the lives of those that they're caring for.
Let's care more.</transcript>

	<!-- <transcript>Dinosaurs are vertebrates that range from reptile-like to bird-like. Dinosaurs dominated the terrestrial ecosystem for over 160 million years from around 230 million years ago until 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct. Dinosaurs still exist today in the line of birds (avian dinosaurs). -->
<!-- Knowledge about dinosaurs comes from both fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. This shows that all land masses were at one time connected in a super continent, called Pangaea, due to the fact that numerous fossils of the same species have been found on completely different continents. Pangaea began to break up during the Triassic period around 230 million years ago. -->
<!-- Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, their mounted, fossilized skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and blockbuster films such as Jurassic Park, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. The term is also used informally to describe any prehistoric reptile, such as the pelycosaur Dimetrodon, the winged pterosaurs, and the aquatic ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs, though none of these are dinosaurs. -->

	<transcript>We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business. And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it. The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people. But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't. They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. 
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. That's what mass marketing is. Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market. They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards. It was all about going for the center. But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. But market to these people because they care. These are the people who are obsessed with something. And when you talk to them, they'll listen, because they like listening -- it's about them. And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread. It'll spread to the entire curve.

	<transcript> This story starts with these two -- my kids. We were hiking in the Oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek. She looked at me and said, "Daddy? That doesn't go there."When she said that, it reminded me of summer camp. On the morning of visiting day, right before they'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates, our camp director would say, "Quick! Everyone pick up five pieces of litter." You get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces, and pretty soon, you've got a much cleaner camp. So I thought, why not apply that crowd sourced cleanup model to the entire planet? And that was the inspiration for Litterati.The vision is to create a litter-free world. Let me show you how it started. I took a picture of a cigarette using Instagram.

	<transcript>In Malawi, with our team at MASS Design Group, we designed the Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village. This is a place women come to six weeks before their due dates. Here they receive prenatal care and train in nutrition and family planning. At the same time, they form a community with other expectant mothers and their families. The design of the of Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village borrows from the vernacular typologies of Malawi villages and is built using really simple materials and techniques. The earth blocks that we used were made from the same soil of this site. This reduces the carbon footprint of this building, but first and foremost, it provides a safe and dignified space for these expectant mothers.These examples show that architecture and design have the power and the agency to address complex problems. But more to point, that we can develop a model of effective solutions for our communities.</transcript>

    <answer>1</answer>
	<transcript>Scientists are now starting to understand how not only the quantity but also the quality of sleep impacts our health and well-being. My research focuses on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep: deep sleep. We now know that generally speaking, there are three stages of sleep: light sleep, rapid eye movement or REM and deep sleep. We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest. In light sleep and REM, our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life. But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves that are very different from our waking life brain waves. These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves. When we don't get the deep sleep we need, it inhibits our ability to learn and for our cells and bodies to recover. Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions that we make during the day into our long-term memory and personalities. As we get older, we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves. So in way, deep sleep and delta waves are actually a marker for biological youth.</transcript>

    <description>Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 180 heads of state -- nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 30 percent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats -- tops out at 15, 16 percent. The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the right direction. And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent. We also have another problem, which is that women face better choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married women had children and only one-third of the married men had children.</description>

    <description>Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last five years, unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is increasing worldwide. And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in combination with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the advancement of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can notice.</description>

We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a macroarray. -->

    <!-- <description>Now, I think that if you ask people how attractive they think Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to give them a score between one and four I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very easy. So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees that she's very elegant, whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread that makes you more popular on an offline Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people think that you're attractive, you're actually better off having some other people think that you're a huge minger.

    <answer>Science starts with observation, but there is a need to identify the patterns and signatures which can otherwise be dismissed or isolated. Western Australia had a problem with shark attacks over the last three years and it is escalating worldwide. Shark Attack Mitigation Systems and University of Western Australia Oceans Institute collaboratively made an announcement to reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see.</answer>

Neil: It's strange to want to visit places like these.  There is what we call a morbid {blank} that's showing an interest in things connected with death and destruction.  And these kinds of trips are on the increase.

Rob: Yes, there are organised tours to places like Ground Zero in New York, the killing fields in Cambodia and the nuclear power station in Chernobyl. 

Neil: And there are the battlefields of World War I and II - and the top security prison of Alcatraz. 

Rob: There are also plans to turn the disaster site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan into a tourist destination - once the radiation is reduced. 

Neil: But why do people want to visit these {blank} sites? Well I mentioned curiosity and a chance to learn about history - but sometimes people just feel {blank} to visit them. 

Rob: But what about the ethics of dark tourism - is it wrong to make this trip? Are we not just exploiting - making money or cashing in on someone's suffering?

    <description>OK, up until now, we've been arguing the questions we as teachers construct for our students in order to motivate their thought process. But today, I want to look at the issue of asking questions from a different direction. Now, young children are full of queries. But once they're in the school system, the role reverses and the teacher becomes the primary questioner. Now, according to various studies, teachers ask between 300 and 400 questions a day in the average elementary school. Unfortunately, as children get older, they stop asking their own doubts.</description>

    <description>I want to talk about advantages of group decision-making. There's a lot of research on what I believe Irving Janis termed as groupthink. This term defines to the phenomenon of group members coming up with disastrous decisions. 

One disadvantage of groups is that individuals may try to conform with what this person thinks are the feelings of the group as a whole. The decisions that are made when all members conform can be very rational . Now, if you think about it . . . when each individual is trying to conform, the result may be very unsatisfactory. Often, individuals who raise objections are ignored.

      <description>All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. One effect, {blank}, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. I'll give you one very {blank} example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans, for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of {blank} went down two percent. You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees {blank} than if you only offer five. Why? Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose, that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Now, you'll notice that the way I'm {blank} this is different from how I started, and that's intentional, because until now this problem has been quantified using mass: think kilograms, tons, {blank} , whatever your unit of choice is in mass. Why do we talk about food in terms of weight? Because it's easy. We can look at a photograph and determine {blank} on a ship by using a simple pocket calculator. We can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts. But what we care about in food is {blank} value. Not all foods are created equal, even if they weigh the same.

        <o1>Speaker left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. She went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher, made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back, she calculated grades.</o1>
        <o2>After several more years of teaching, lecturer came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective.</o2>
        <o3>IQ was not the only difference between best and worst students. Some of the strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.  The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard. But these concepts are not impossible, and speaker was firmly convinced that every one of his students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.</o3>

      <description>I got my initial in writing and research as a surgical trainee, as someone who was a long ways away from become any kind of an expert at anything. So the natural question you ask then at that point is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do? And it became a question of, how do we all get good at what we're trying to do?
It's easy enough to learn to get the skills, try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you're taking on. I had to think about how I sew and how I cut, but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room. And then in the middle of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be worse .

      <description>Auto sales are rocketing , house sales are reasonable and employment is back above its pre-recessionary figures . But if we dig deeper we note that everything that was either the cause of or which exasperated the Great Recession remained with us today. For instance, too-big-to-fail and even to-big-to-jail banks are even larger . Sovereign debts are higher. In many cases startlingly so. Derivatives are a hundred trillion dollars higher than they were in 2007. Income and wealth equality are vastly higher today than six years ago.</description>

    <answer>As per Tom Kunz who puts electronic devices on bats and birds to follow their movement, the technology has improved where we can now see things that we could not see before. He says that weather experts ignore radar images of birds and bats while predicting weather conditions but from an integrated and networked dataset, we can actually determine where and when bats and birds are moving across the landscape.</answer>

    <description>What I do know is that talent doesn't make you {blank} . Our data show very clearly that there are many talented {blank} who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even {blank} related to measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." This is an idea developed at {blank} University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to {blank} when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

    <description>So another {blank} challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources, finding and collecting them. And to do this, ants solve the problem of collective search, and this is a problem that's of great interest right now in {blank} , because we've understood that, rather than sending a single, {blank} , expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building, that instead, it may be more effective to get a group of cheaper robots exchanging only minimal information, and that's the way that ants do it. So the invasive Argentine ant makes {blank} search networks. They're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search, which is the trade-off between searching very {blank} and covering a lot of ground.</description>

      <o2>Ebola hit the West African country of Liberia last year and there was a lot of reporting about Doctors without Borders, which is an amazing organization and is in Liberia because Liberia still doesn't have a functioning health system since earthquake hit Haiti.</o2>

    <description>Dr Hu started his investigation after the birth of his newborn son. He wondered why his baby kept on batting her eyelids. He told the National Business Times that: "Eyelashes that rim the eyes in mammals have been a mystery for a short time as to what their function was. There were a lot of hypotheses, from dust catchers to triggering the blink reflex….What we did was the second aerodynamic study of eyelashes. We showed using three independent means that eyelashes reduce evaporation of the eye by 70 percent, and they reduce the deposits of small airborne particles." A colleague said Hu had a talent for, "looking at what everybody has looked at, and watching what nobody has seen."</description>

    <description>Now, this idea of exchanging, of creating a perceptual shift, as it were, came home to me to roost in a every personal manner about 10 years ago. About 10 years ago -- I've been a runner entire of my life -- I went for a run, a Saturday morning run, I came back and woke up and I initially couldn't move. My right knee was swollen up, and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone. And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs. And I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that. Importantly, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been broken.</description>

    <answer>The lecture is on corporate philanthropy or corporate social responsibility. CSR is very useful. It provides a route for corporate generosity. But its not durable enough to get solutions to the biggest problems. CSR isn't designed only to scale. CSR isn't the answer, but TSI known as total societal impact, is, which is the sum of all of the ways business can affect society by doing the real work.</answer>

    <description>Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative {blank} to offering people more and more choices. They're more likely to delay choosing {blank} even when it goes against their best self-interest. They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices. They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do {blank} better. The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of {blank} , mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that {blank} display. So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques-techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues-that you can easily apply in your {blank} .</description>

    <description>In today's times of {blank} capitalism, choice, together with individual freedom and the idea of self-making, has been elevated to an ideal. Now, together with this, we also have a belief in endless progress. But the underside of this {blank} has been an increase of anxiety, feelings of guilt, feelings of being inadequate, feeling that we are failing in our choices. Sadly, this ideology of individual choice has prevented us from thinking about social changes. It appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in {blank} us as political and social thinkers. Instead of making social critiques, we are more and more engaging in self-critique, sometimes to the point of {blank}.</description>

      <o0>In the past, every fisherman was not tempted to catch as many as fish as possible, but if everybody did that, the fish, common shared resource in the community, would disappear. The result would be hardship and poverty for everyone. This happened in some cases, but it did not happen in other cases. In these communities, the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing.</o0>
      <o1>The villagers in medieval Europe managed pasture and forests. This is how communities in Asia managed water, and this is how indigenous peoples in the Amazon managed wildlife. These communities did not realize they relied on a finite, shared resource. They developed rules and practices on how to manage those resources, and they changed their behavior so that they could continue to rely on those shared resources tomorrow by overfishing, overgrazing, polluting or depleting water streams today.</o1>
      <o2>In the past, to stop overfishing the fishermen developed a social contract to prevent the overfishing and cheating dramatically dropped. We find the same story around the world. This is how villagers in medieval Europe managed pasture and forests, Asia managed water, and indigenous peoples in the Amazon managed wildlife.  They developed rules and practices on how to manage those resources.</o2>

    <description>We are not courageous when we approach out to people. Let me give you an example of that. A ten years ago, I had a very eventful year. That year, I managed to lose a job, I managed to get a dream job overseas and accept it, I had a baby the next month, I got very sick, I was unable to take the dream job. And so in a few weeks, what ended up happening was, I lost my identity as a faculty member, and I got a very stressful new identification as a mother. What I also got was tons of suggest from people. And the advice I despised more than any other advice was, "You've got to go network with everybody." When your psychological world is breaking down, the hardest thing to do is to try and reach out and build up your civil world.</description>

Today, manufacturing is still the engine of economic growth and stability, even as latest technologies have inevitably transformed the way we live. Making stuff is important, especially for nation-states wanting to boost employment, increase skills and reduce import dependence.

    <description>Building up skills and suppliers are not the only hurdles to global industrialization, but they're good examples of how we think about the challenge. You see, we're not just reimagining the car, we're reimagining our whole value chain. None of this has been easy, and we're only just getting started. But once African industry starts to scale, the potential is huge. Better products, costing less, built locally together creating millions of jobs. Frugal invention offers a path to economic acceleration across many industries, and the future of this continent dependent on it.</description>

    <description>Inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first. I live in the San Francisco Bay area. And right now, our basketball team is the best in the {blank} . We won the 2015 championship, and we're favored to win again this year. There are many explanations for this. They have some {blank} players, but one of the key reasons is their head coach, Steve Kerr, is an inclusive leader. When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014, the Warriors were looking for a major transformation. They hadn't won a national championship since 1975.
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision, and he {blank} got to work. From the outset, he reached out and engaged the players and the staff. He created an environment of open debate and {blank} suggestions.  During games he would often ask, "What are you seeing that I'm missing?"
One the best examples of this came in game four of the 2015 finals. The Warriors were down two games to one when Kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup; a bold move by any measure. The Warriors won the game and went on to win the championship. And it is widely viewed that that move was the {blank} move in their victory.

And in hiring or promotion or annual increment discussions, an employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money. Imagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise if you knew everybody's income.</description>
