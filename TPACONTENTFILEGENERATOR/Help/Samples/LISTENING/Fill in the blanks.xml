      <description>Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other {blank}, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist {blank} put forward by Karl Popper and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and {blank} the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be {blank}. If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good {blank} model for time and say what {blank} it makes.</description>
